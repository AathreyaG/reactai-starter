### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend is built with modular React components for scalability and maintainability:
    - **Header Component**: Manages navigation and user actions.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays the product catalog with pagination, sorting, and filtering features.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides detailed product views and editing capabilities.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Facilitates CSV file uploads with drag-and-drop functionality.
    - **ExportComponent**: Enables downloading catalog data as CSV files.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Offers a comprehensive component library with a cohesive visual design.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal accessibility standards and a consistent user experience.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts and validates CSV file uploads for storage on S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves a list of products with sorting and filtering options.
    - **POST**: Adds new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches details of a specific product.
    - **PUT**: Updates an existing product's details.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a product from the catalog.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Exports product data to a CSV file stored on S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Uses the **Multer** library for efficient file uploads.
  - **Validations**: Ensures data integrity with the **Joi** library for structural validation.
  - **Background Processing**: Utilizes **AWS Lambda** for asynchronous tasks like CSV file validation to enhance performance.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Automates deployment and scaling of Node.js applications with monitoring.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Stores both raw and processed CSV files.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Provides a reliable, scalable relational database solution.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages API traffic with integrated security and validation features.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user identity, ensuring secure authentication and authorization.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Integrated with **CodeBuild** and **CodeDeploy** for a streamlined continuous integration and deployment process, enabling efficient updates.

### Explanation of the Diagram

- **Users**: The GSA Acquisition Workforce interacts with the platform to manage the supply catalog.
- **Frontend Application**: A React and TypeScript-based web application serves as the user interface for uploading and managing catalog data.
- **API Gateway**: Amazon API Gateway manages request routing, validation, and authorization.
- **Backend Services**:
  - **Application Server**: A Node.js and Express server processes business logic and data transactions.
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS stores the supply catalog data.
  - **File Storage**: Amazon S3 stores uploaded CSV files and provides export storage.
