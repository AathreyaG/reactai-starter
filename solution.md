### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend application will be organized into reusable components, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
  - **Components** include:
    - **Header Component**: Provides navigation and displays user information.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays product catalog with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Allows users to view and edit product details.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Provides an interface for users to upload CSV files, with capabilities for drag-and-drop.
    - **ExportComponent**: Enables users to download catalog data as CSV.
  
- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Used for its rich set of components and consistency in UI design.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal design standards for accessibility and usability.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV files for validation and upload to S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves product lists with sorting and filtering.
    - **POST**: Adds new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed product information.
    - **PUT**: Updates an existing product's details.
    - **DELETE**: Deletes a product.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates a CSV export of product data, stored in S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Utilizes **Multer** for processing file uploads, specifically CSV data.
  - **Validations**: Employs **Joi** for validating data structure and integrity.
  - **Background Processing**: Offloads heavy tasks to **AWS Lambda** for asynchronous execution, enhancing user response time.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Automatically handles deployment and scaling for the Node.js application.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Provides a reliable storage solution for uploaded CSV files and exported data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Delivers a managed database for reliable and scalable storage.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages API requests, routing, and security concerns.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Facilitates secure user authentication and authorization.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD process, integrating CodeBuild and CodeDeploy for streamlined deployments.
  
This architectural framework is designed to ensure that the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform is scalable, efficient, and meets the required compliance standards.
