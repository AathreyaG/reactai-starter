Below is a detailed technical architecture plan for the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform structured using the C4-PlantUML format. This architecture leverages React with TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for the backend, all deployed on AWS services.

### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend application is structured using React and TypeScript for added robustness and maintainability.
  - Key components include:
    - **Header Component**: Handles navigation and branding.
    - **ProductList Component**: Lists products with search and pagination capabilities.
    - **ProductDetails Component**: Provides detailed information and editing functionality for products.
    - **CSVUpload Component**: Manages CSV file uploads with client-side validation.
    - **ExportButton Component**: Allows users to export catalog data as a CSV.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Offers a consistent and customizable UI component library.
  - **USWDS Components**: To ensure compliance with federal standards for accessibility.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Handles CSV file uploads, validates, and stores them in S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves the product list with filtering and pagination.
    - **POST**: Adds new products from request payload.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches specific product data by ID.
    - **PUT**: Updates product information by ID.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a product by ID.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates the export of product catalog as a CSV to S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **CSV Upload Handling**: Utilizes **Multer** for file handling and **Joi** for data validation.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: **AWS Lambda** handles tasks like CSV validation asynchronously to avoid blocking main application flows.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys the Node.js backend, providing scalability and simplified management.
  
- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Provides durable and global file storage for CSV files.
  
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Secure and reliable relational database with automated backups.
  
- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages API endpoints with security and request/response processing.
  
- **Security**:
  - **AWS Secrets Manager**: Manages sensitive configurations securely.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
  - **AWS CodeBuild**: Automates compilation and testing of application components.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Ensures smooth and efficient deployments.

This design focuses on scalability, reliability, and security, aligning with AWS's modern practices to build a maintainable and robust web application that meets the business objectives of the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform.
