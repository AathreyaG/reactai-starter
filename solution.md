' Notes for additional context
note right of webApp
- Uses React Router for navigation
- Axios for making HTTP requests.
- Implements USWDS components for accessibility and compliance.
end note

note right of appServer
- Handles CSV parsing with csv-parser and validations with Joi.
- Uses Sequelize ORM for managing and querying PostgreSQL.
- Implements RESTful API endpoints for catalog operations, including delete.

### Detailed Components Explanation

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: A user interface element allowing the selection and uploading of CSV files. It performs client-side validations before sending the file to the backend via HTTP requests.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Displays catalog data in a table format, enables inline editing, deletion, and communicates with the backend to submit updates using RESTful APIs.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Allows users to download the catalog in various formats. It interacts with the backend to generate and fetch these files.

**State Management and Routing:**

- **Redux**: Manages the application state centrally, ensuring data consistency and a seamless user experience across different components.
- **React Router**: Facilitates navigation between pages within the application, such as upload, edit, and review sections.

**UI Frameworks:**

- **USWDS Components**: Provides design elements that ensure compliance with government accessibility standards, enhancing the user experience while maintaining a consistent look and feel.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**: Handles multipart/form-data requests for CSV uploads. Returns a JSON response indicating success or failure after processing.
- **/api/catalog/search**: Handles GET requests with specific search criteria, returning matching entries in JSON format.
- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: Supports PUT requests to update catalog entries, identified by a unique ID, with the request and response formatted in JSON.
- **/api/catalog/delete/{id}**: Supports DELETE requests to remove catalog entries, identified by a unique ID.
- **/api/catalog/export**: Provides downloadable catalog files in requested formats through a predefined endpoint.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Uses Node.js libraries to manage file uploads, storing them temporarily in Amazon S3, and updating file-related metadata in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Validation**: Employs server-side validation using Joi and database constraints to maintain data quality and integrity.
- **Background Processing**: Utilizes AWS Lambda to handle resource-intensive tasks asynchronously, improving server performance and responsiveness.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Deploys frontend assets on Amazon S3, utilizing CloudFront for global content distribution and enhanced performance.
- **Backend Deployment**: Utilizes AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying and managing the Node.js environment, offering scalability and load balancing.
- **File Storage**: Leverages Amazon S3 for secure and scalable file storage.
- **Database**: Uses Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for a managed database solution, providing automatic backups and scalability.
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway manages API requests with features like throttling and monitoring to ensure optimal performance.
- **Security**: Secures sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager, with Amazon Cognito managing user authentication and authorization.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Implement AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate testing and deployments, streamlining the transition from development to production environments and ensuring consistent delivery processes.
