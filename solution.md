### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend architecture is designed to be modular, composed of React components for scalability and maintainability. The main components include:
    - **Header Component**: Manages navigation and user actions, ensuring easy access to different sections.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays the product catalog with options for pagination, sorting, and filtering of the data.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides an interface to view and edit the details of individual products.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Facilitates the uploading of CSV files, implementing drag-and-drop functionality for user convenience.
    - **ExportComponent**: Allows users to export the catalog data as CSV files, integrating with backend services for file download.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Selected for its extensive component library which helps maintain consistent visual design and improves development speed.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal accessibility standards, providing a consistent user experience across the application.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - The API is structured around REST principles, with the following endpoints:
    - **/api/upload**:
      - **POST**: Handles CSV file uploads, performs validation checks, and stores them on Amazon S3.
    - **/api/products**:
      - **GET**: Retrieves a list of products, supporting sorting and filtering capabilities.
      - **POST**: Adds new product entries to the catalog.
    - **/api/products/:id**:
      - **GET**: Fetches details of a specific product.
      - **PUT**: Updates product details.
      - **DELETE**: Removes a product from the catalog.
    - **/api/export**:
      - **GET**: Exports product data to a CSV file, saved on Amazon S3 for user download.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Utilizes the **Multer** library for seamless file upload handling.
  - **Validations**: Ensures data integrity using **Joi** for comprehensive data validation.
  - **Background Processing**: Employs **AWS Lambda** for non-blocking tasks such as CSV validation and processing, optimizing backend performance.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Provides automatic deployment and scaling of the Node.js application, with integrated performance monitoring.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Responsible for storing both raw and processed CSV files, facilitating easy access and management.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Delivers a scalable, reliable relational database solution for storing catalog data.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Ensures efficient routing of API traffic, with integrated security and validation features.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user identities, providing secure authentication and authorization services.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Used in conjunction with **CodeBuild** and **CodeDeploy** to automate the continuous integration and deployment process, ensuring efficient and reliable updates.
