Here is a detailed, structured technical architecture for a web application designed to facilitate the GSA Acquisition Workforce's management of the Global Supply catalog. This architecture is built upon a strong foundation of standardized components and AWS services to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: Responsible for file selection, preview, and uploading. Communicates with the backend using HTTP requests with `multipart/form-data` to submit CSV files.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Displays the catalog in a table format, featuring inline editing and deletion capabilities. It sends RESTful API requests to update or delete catalog records.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Facilitates export operations, allowing users to download the catalog in various formats.

**State Management and UI Framework:**

- **Redux**: Manages application state across components, ensuring consistent data flow.
- **React Router**: Enables a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience with client-side routing.
- **USWDS Components**: Utilized for UI elements to ensure compliance with accessibility standards relevant to government applications.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**:
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Request**: HTTP form-data containing the CSV file.
  - **Response**: JSON indicating success or failure with detailed error messages if applicable.
  
- **/api/catalog/search**:
  - **Method**: GET
  - **Request**: JSON containing search parameters like keywords or filters.
  - **Response**: JSON array with catalog entries matching the search criteria.

- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**:
  - **Method**: PUT
  - **Request**: JSON payload with updated catalog entry details.
  - **Response**: JSON indicating the result of the update operation.

- **/api/catalog/delete/{id}**:
  - **Method**: DELETE
  - **Request**: The ID of the catalog entry to be deleted.
  - **Response**: JSON indicating success or failure of the deletion operation.

- **/api/catalog/export**:
  - **Method**: GET
  - **Request**: Query parameters specifying the export format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
  - **Response**: File download in the requested format.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Uploaded CSVs are temporarily stored in Amazon S3, and metadata is recorded in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Validation**: Implemented using the Joi library for schema validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Background Processing**: AWS Lambda handles resource-intensive tasks asynchronously to offload work from the main server, triggered by S3 events or queue messages.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Static assets for the frontend are hosted on Amazon S3, with CloudFront CDN for low-latency global distribution.
- **Backend Deployment**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates deployment, scaling, and management of Node.js applications.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 serves as the storage solution for both temporary and archived CSV files.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS hosts PostgreSQL, providing a managed, reliable, and scalable database service.
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway facilitates API versioning, request throttling, and security enforcement.
- **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager securely handles sensitive configuration data. Amazon Cognito manages authentication and user sessions.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Use AWS CodePipeline in conjunction with AWS CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment, facilitating seamless automated testing, building, and deployments triggered by code changes.
