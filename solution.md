### Detailed Components Explanation

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: Provides the UI for file selection and performs basic client-side validations. Interfaces with the backend to upload files for processing.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Renders catalog data in a table allowing inline edits and communicates changes through backend APIs.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Offers options to download catalog data in formats like CSV or JSON, interacting with the backend to generate and fetch these files.

**State Management and Routing:**

- **Redux**: Utilized for centralized state management, ensuring consistent catalog data presentation across the application.
- **React Router**: Provides seamless navigation between different functionalities like uploading, searching, and editing.

**UI Frameworks:**

- **USWDS Components**: Ensures consistent and accessible UI design in compliance with government standards.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**: Accepts CSV files through multi-part form-data. Processes and returns a JSON response indicating the operation's success or failure.
- **/api/catalog/search**: Supports GET requests with queries to return JSON data matching specified criteria (e.g., NSN, description).
- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: Handles updates to catalog entries based on an ID, with JSON input and output confirming the operation's success.
- **/api/catalog/export**: Generates files in requested formats and serves them for download.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Uploads are processed using Node.js libraries, with files stored in S3 and metadata updated in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Validation**: Enforced through a combination of client checks and server-side validation using Joi and database constraints.
- **Background Processing**: Heavy tasks are offloaded to AWS Lambda, ensuring non-blocking server operations for performance optimization.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Frontend assets hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via CloudFront for global reach and performance.
- **Backend Deployment**: Node.js server deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, providing an auto-scalable environment with load balancing.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 used for secure and scalable file storage.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for managed database solutions offering automatic backups and scaling.
- **API Management**: Managed by Amazon API Gateway, including request throttling and monitoring.
- **Security**: Sensitive data managed by AWS Secrets Manager; user access controlled via Amazon Cognito.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Employ AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate testing, integration, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid and consistent delivery from development to production.
