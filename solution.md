### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, ensuring code maintainability and robustness.
  - Component Structure:
    - **Header Component**: Provides navigation and branding.
    - **ProductList Component**: Displays products with search and pagination features.
    - **ProductDetails Component**: Allows viewing and editing of detailed product information.
    - **CSVUpload Component**: Manages the file upload process with client-side validation.
    - **ExportButton Component**: Facilitates exporting catalog data as a CSV.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Offers a customizable and consistent UI component library.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with federal standards for accessibility.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts and processes CSV files, performs validation, and stores them in S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Fetches product listings, supports filtering and pagination.
    - **POST**: Adds new product data to the database from the request payload.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves specific product data by ID.
    - **PUT**: Updates product details by ID with partial updates supported.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a product by ID.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates CSV file export of the product catalog to S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **CSV Upload Handling**: Uses **Multer** for file handling and **Joi** for data validation.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: **AWS Lambda** processes tasks like CSV validation outside of main application flow.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys the Node.js backend offering scalability and easy management.
  
- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Stores CSV files with high durability and global accessibility.
  
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Provides a robust relational database service with automated backups.
  
- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Secures and manages API endpoints, including request/response handling.
  
- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user authentication, enabling secure access.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates build, test, and deployment stages.
  - **AWS CodeBuild**: Compiles and tests application components.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Manages smooth and efficient deployment processes.

This architecture aligns with a modern, scalable web application approach using AWS services to ensure security, reliability, and maintainability, while meeting business goals and operational requirements.
