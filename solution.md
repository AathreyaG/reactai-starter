' Notes for additional context
note right of webApp
- Uses React Router for navigation
- Axios for making HTTP requests.
- Implements USWDS components for accessibility and compliance.
end note

note right of appServer
- Handles CSV parsing with csv-parser and validations with Joi.
- Uses Sequelize ORM for managing and querying PostgreSQL.
- Implements RESTful API endpoints for catalog operations, including delete functionality.

### Detailed Components Explanation

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: Allows users to select and upload CSV files, performing client-side validations. Interfaces with the backend using HTTP requests to upload files for processing.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Displays catalog data in a dynamic table allowing inline edits and delete operations, communicating changes through RESTful APIs to the backend.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Provides options to download catalog data in various formats (CSV, JSON) by generating and fetching these files from the backend.

**State Management and Routing:**

- **Redux**: Centralizes state management, ensuring a consistent catalog data presentation across the application.
- **React Router**: Enables seamless navigation between pages such as upload, search, edit, and delete functionalities.

**UI Frameworks:**

- **USWDS Components**: Ensures that the UI design is consistent and meets government accessibility standards.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**: Accepts multipart form-data for CSV files. Processes these files and returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.
- **/api/catalog/search**: Handles GET requests with query parameters to retrieve JSON data matching specific criteria.
- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: Supports PUT requests for updating catalog entries identified by an ID, using JSON input and output to confirm changes.
- **/api/catalog/delete/{id}**: Handles DELETE requests for removing catalog entries, ensuring secure and authorized operations.
- **/api/catalog/export**: Generates and provides downloadable files in the requested formats.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Uses Node.js libraries for file uploads, storing them in Amazon S3, and updating metadata in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Validation**: Combines client-side checks with server-side validation using Joi and database constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Background Processing**: Employs AWS Lambda for asynchronous execution of resource-intensive tasks, optimizing server performance.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Deploy frontend assets on Amazon S3 and distribute them via CloudFront for improved global accessibility and performance.
- **Backend Deployment**: Utilize AWS Elastic Beanstalk for an auto-scalable Node.js environment with integrated load balancing.
- **File Storage**: Store secure, scalable files on Amazon S3.
- **Database**: Leverage Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for managed database solutions that include automatic backups and scaling capabilities.
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway handles request management, including throttling and monitoring features.
- **Security**: Secure sensitive data with AWS Secrets Manager, while user access is managed through Amazon Cognito.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Implement AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for continuous integration and continuous deployment, automating testing and deployment processes to streamline delivery from development to production environments.

These updates provide a comprehensive view of how the architecture is adjusted to incorporate the delete functionality, ensuring that all components are aligned with the new requirements.
