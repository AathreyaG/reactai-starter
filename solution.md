### Detailed Components Explanation

#### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: Handles the user interface for selecting and uploading CSV files. Files are sent to the backend using `multipart/form-data`.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Displays catalog data in a table format, enabling users to view and interact with catalog entries. Supports inline editing, with updates sent via RESTful API calls.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Allows users to request downloads of the entire catalog in various formats.

**State Management and UI Framework:**

- **Redux**: Manages application state efficiently, ensuring data consistency and sharing across components.
- **React Router**: Facilitates smooth in-app navigation suitable for single-page applications (SPAs).
- **USWDS Components**: Ensures adherence to government accessibility standards and uniform user interface.

#### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**: Accepts CSV files, processes uploads, and responds with JSON indicating success or error.
- **/api/catalog/search**: GET endpoint providing search functionality for catalog entries, returning results in JSON format.
- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: PUT request to update catalog entries, with payload and response both in JSON format.
- **/api/catalog/export**: Facilitates CSV or specific format downloads of the catalog upon request.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Files uploaded are temporarily stored on S3, with metadata captured in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Validation**: Utilizes the Joi library for robust validation, ensuring consistent and high-quality incoming data.
- **Background Processing**: AWS Lambda executes resource-intensive jobs asynchronously, improving system performance and responsiveness.

#### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Frontend assets are served from Amazon S3 and distributed globally using CloudFront.
- **Backend Deployment**: Runs on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy scalability and management.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 provides secure and scalable storage for all uploaded files.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS powers PostgreSQL to deliver a reliable database solution.
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway handles APIs, integrating security, throttling, and endpoint management.
- **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager secures credentials and API keys, while Amazon Cognito handles user authentication.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Implement AWS CodePipeline with CodeBuild to automate testing and streamlined application deployment, enhancing development workflows and reducing manual errors.

Overall, this architecture emphasizes scalability, security, and maintainability, ensuring that the application can handle current requirements while adapting to future needs.
