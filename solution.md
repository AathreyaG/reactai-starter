### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The application is modular, using React for its component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety.
  - Components include:
    - **Header Component**: Contains navigation and branding elements.
    - **ProductList Component**: Displays catalog items with filtering and pagination.
    - **ProductDetails Component**: Allows viewing and editing specific product details.
    - **CSVUpload Component**: Handles uploading of CSV files, with client-side validation.
    - **ExportButton Component**: Triggers the export of catalog data in CSV format.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Provides a modern, responsive, and reusable component library.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with federal accessibility standards.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**: 
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV file uploads, validates, and stores them in AWS S3.
  - **/api/products**: 
    - **GET**: Retrieves product listings with support for filtering and pagination.
    - **POST**: Adds new products based on provided data.
  - **/api/products/:id**: 
    - **GET**: Fetches product data by ID.
    - **PUT**: Updates the product details by ID.
    - **DELETE**: Deletes a product by ID.
  - **/api/export**: 
    - **GET**: Initiates export of product catalog as CSV to S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Utilizes **Multer** for handling file uploads, and **Joi** for JSON validation.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses **AWS Lambda** for non-blocking CSV validation and processing.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosts the Node.js application server, allowing auto-scaling and easy management.
  
- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Provides scalable and durable storage for CSV files and exports.
  
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Offers a managed relational database service with high availability.
  
- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Provides a secure and scalable method to expose RESTful endpoints.
  
- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Facilitates user authentication and secures access management.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates build, test, and deployment phases.
  - **AWS CodeBuild**: Automates code compilation and testing.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Manages the deployment of the application to the Elastic Beanstalk. 

This architecture is designed to ensure scalability, robustness, and security, aligning with AWS best practices while effectively meeting the business objectives of the platform.
