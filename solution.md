### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend application will be organized into reusable components, providing a maintainable and scalable architecture.
  - **Components** include:
    - **Header Component**: Provides navigation and displays user information.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays product catalog with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Allows users to view and edit product details.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Offers an interface for users to upload CSV files, supporting drag-and-drop functionality.
    - **ExportComponent**: Enables users to download catalog data as CSV.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Utilized for its comprehensive set of components and consistent UI design.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal design standards for accessibility and usability.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV files for validation and storage in S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves product lists with optional sorting and filtering.
    - **POST**: Adds new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed product information.
    - **PUT**: Updates an existing product's details.
    - **DELETE**: Deletes a product.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates and retrieves a CSV export of product data, stored in S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Uses **Multer** for handling file uploads, specifically processing CSV data.
  - **Validations**: Employs **Joi** for validating data structure and ensuring integrity.
  - **Background Processing**: Offloads resource-intensive tasks to **AWS Lambda** for asynchronous execution, facilitating better user response times.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Automatically manages deployment and scaling for the Node.js application.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Provides reliable storage solutions for uploaded CSV files and exported data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Delivers a managed database environment for reliable, scalable data storage.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages API requests, routing, and security features.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Provides secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the entire CI/CD process, integrating with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy for streamlined deployments.

This architectural framework is geared towards ensuring that the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform is scalable, efficient, and compliant with the necessary standards.
