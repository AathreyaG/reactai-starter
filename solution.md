### Explanation

**1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript):**

- **Component Structure**:
  - **Header**: Manages navigation across different sections like CSV upload and catalog management using React Router.
  - **CSVUploader**: Utilizes `react-dropzone` for file uploads and communicates with the backend through `/uploadCSV` endpoint. It includes client-side validation using USWDS components to ensure accessibility.
  - **CatalogViewer**: Displays catalog data with search, pagination, and sorting features. It uses the backend `/catalog` endpoint for data fetching and React's Context API for state management.
  - **ProductEditor**: Allows editing of catalog entries and updates through `/catalog/:id` endpoint.
  - **Footer**: Provides static information such as application version and contact details.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **USWDS**: Ensures accessibility and a consistent UI design across all user interfaces.
  - **Metrostar Comet**: Enhances interactive components for improved user experience.

**2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL):**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **`POST /uploadCSV`**: Accepts CSV uploads, processes files, and returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.
  - **`GET /catalog`**: Retrieves catalog data in a paginated format with support for query parameter-based filtering and sorting.
  - **`PUT /catalog/:id`**: Updates catalog entries with a JSON payload.
  - **`GET /catalog/download`**: Generates and serves a downloadable CSV file of the catalog.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Managed by `Multer` middleware for uploads and `csv-parser` for CSV processing.
  - **Validations**: Enforced using `Joi` to ensure data integrity.
  - **Background Processing**: Handled by `Bull` for asynchronous tasks such as processing large CSV datasets.

**3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment:**

- **AWS Services**:
  - **Hosting**: Managed by AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application scaling and deployment.
  - **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for storing CSVs and static files.
  - **Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for persistent catalog data management.
  - **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway for routing and managing API requests.
  - **Security**: Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization management.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes ensure continuous integration and delivery with code change triggers.

This architecture leverages AWS for scalable and secure deployment while ensuring maintainability and alignment with the GSA's business goals for the catalog platform.
