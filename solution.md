Based on the provided context and requirements, here is a comprehensive technical architecture for the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform, focusing on a high-level design for the frontend, backend, and AWS infrastructure.

### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The application uses a modular architecture where React components are built with TypeScript for type safety and structure.
  - **Components** include:
    - **Header Component**: Contains navigation and branding, often utilizing context or state management for user session details.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays a list of products with support for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Shows detailed information for each product, allowing editing and saving changes.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Manages the user interface for uploading CSV files, including drag-and-drop file upload support and real-time validation feedback.
    - **ExportComponent**: Provides functionalities to download catalog data as a CSV file.
  
- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Provides a customizable and responsive UI component library, ensuring a professional look and feel.
  - **USWDS Components**: Utilized to maintain compliance with US federal design standards, focusing on accessibility and user experience.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV files and passes them for server-side validation and subsequent upload to AWS S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves the list of products with filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
    - **POST**: Adds new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed product information by ID.
    - **PUT**: Updates an existing product's details.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a product from the database.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates the export of product data to a CSV file, stored in S3 for download.
  
- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Uses middleware like **Multer** for handling multipart/form-data, especially CSV files.
  - **Validations**: Implements JSON schema validation using libraries like **Joi** to ensure data consistency.
  - **Background Processing**: Utilizes **AWS Lambda** for resource-intensive tasks such as CSV validation and processing, ensuring the main application remains responsive.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplifies the deployment and scaling of the Node.js application, managing underlying servers and resources.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Offers scalable and reliable storage for uploaded CSV files and exported catalog data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Provides a managed relational database service, ensuring data durability and availability.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Serves as a front door to the application, handling API routing, request/response transformation, and security.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user authentication, providing security tokens and session management.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deployment phases of the application, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
  - **AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy**: Integrate with CodePipeline to compile source code, run tests, and perform application deployments.
