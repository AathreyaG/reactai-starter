### Detailed Components Explanation

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **CSVUploadComponent**: Allows file selection and uploading to the backend through a multipart/form-data request.
- **CatalogTableComponent**: Displays catalog data in a tabular format. It supports inline editing, with changes sent to the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **CatalogExportComponent**: Facilitates downloading catalogs in specified formats by requesting from the backend.

**State Management and Routing:**

- **Redux**: Centralizes application state management, ensuring consistency across the interface.
- **React Router**: Manages in-app navigation, providing a seamless user experience.

**UI Frameworks:**

- **USWDS Components**: Ensures government accessibility standards, delivering a consistent user interface.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**: Accepts CSV upload requests, returning JSON indicating processing success or failure.
- **/api/catalog/search**: GET endpoint for catalog searches, returning results in JSON.
- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: Supports updating catalog entries, with JSON request and response.
- **/api/catalog/export**: Facilitates downloading catalog files in formats requested.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: Files are uploaded via Node.js, temporarily stored on S3, with associated metadata in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Validation**: Validates data using Joi, ensuring compliance and data quality.
- **Background Processing**: Employs AWS Lambda for resource-intensive tasks asynchronously.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Frontend assets deployed on S3, distributed via CloudFront for performance.
- **Backend Deployment**: Managed on Elastic Beanstalk for scalability.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for secure, scalable file storage.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for managed database solutions.
- **API Management**: API Gateway for request management with features like throttling and monitoring.
- **Security**: Secrets Manager safeguards configurations; Cognito manages authentication.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Utilize AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for automated testing and deployment, ensuring streamlined, repeatable processes.
