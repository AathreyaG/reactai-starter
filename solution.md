### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend application adopts a modular, component-based architecture for ease of maintenance and scalability. The main components are:
    - **Header Component**: Contains the main navigation and displays user information.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Used for presenting the product catalog with features like pagination, sorting, and filtering.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides detailed views for editing specific product details.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Provides a user interface for uploading CSV files via drag-and-drop.
    - **ExportComponent**: Allows users to download the catalog data in CSV format.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: To leverage its rich set of components and to ensure a cohesive user experience across the application.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures adherence to US federal design standards, prioritizing accessibility and usability.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV file uploads for validation before storing in S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves a list of products, with options for sorting and filtering.
    - **POST**: Allows addition of new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed information for a specific product.
    - **PUT**: Updates details of an existing product.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a product from the catalog.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates an export of the product data to CSV and stores the file on S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Managed using the **Multer** library for upload handling.
  - **Validations**: Use the **Joi** library to ensure data integrity and structure.
  - **Background Processing**: **AWS Lambda** handles resource-intensive processes like CSV file validation asynchronously to maintain optimal performance.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Provides a platform for deploying and managing Node.js applications with automatic scaling and monitoring.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Used for storing uploaded CSV files and exported data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: A managed relational database service offering scalability and security.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Handles all API requests, providing routing, authorization, and request validation.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user identity, authentication, and authorization securely.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Integrated with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy to support continuous integration and deployment, ensuring automated and reliable application updates.

This architecture is crafted to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform for managing the GSA Supply Catalog, leveraging AWS services for efficient processing, storage, and security.
