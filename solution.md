Here's a structured technical architecture for the web application based on the provided requirements. This architecture outlines the frontend, backend, AWS infrastructure, and deployment strategy, adhering to the C4-PlantUML format.

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

- **Component Structure**: 
  - **App Component**: The main entry point, responsible for routing and theming.
  - **UploadComponent**: Handles CSV file uploads, invoking backend services.
  - **CatalogComponent**: Displays catalog data in a table with search and sorting functionality.
  - **ExportComponent**: Facilitates downloading of the catalog.
  - **UI Interaction**: The frontend interacts with the backend through RESTful API calls to submit and retrieve catalog data.

- **UI Frameworks/Libraries**: 
  - Use USWDS components for a consistent, accessible, and responsive UI in line with government standards.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /upload**: Accepts CSV files, processes them, and returns a status message.
    - Request: `multipart/form-data` with CSV file.
    - Response: JSON with upload status.
  - **GET /catalog**: Returns catalog data.
    - Request: Parameters for pagination and search filters.
    - Response: JSON with catalog entries.
  - **GET /export**: Triggers catalog data download as a CSV.
    - Request: Optional filters for exporting specific data.
    - Response: CSV file stream.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: CSV files uploaded are stored temporarily in AWS S3 for processing.
  - **Validations**: Ensure CSV meets format specifications; validate entries for mandatory fields and valid data types.
  - **Background Processing**: Utilize AWS Lambda or an SQS-based worker to process CSV files in the background for scalability and reliability.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

- **AWS Services**:
  - **Hosting**: Use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the Node.js application as it simplifies deployment and management.
  - **File Storage**: AWS S3 for storing uploaded CSV files.
  - **Database**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) to store catalog data, benefiting from automated backups and scalability.
  - **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway for handling API requests, enabling request/response transformation, and facilitating monitoring.
  - **Security**: Use AWS Cognito for potential future implementation of user authentication and control access to APIs.

- **Deployment Details**:
  - Deploy frontend using S3 + CloudFront for fast, reliable content delivery.
  - Set up Elastic Beanstalk with a load-balanced environment for the Node.js backend.
  - RDS for the PostgreSQL database to handle large datasets effectively.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations**:
  - Use AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment, enabling automated testing and deployment of both frontend and backend services on code commit.
