Here is the proposed technical architecture for the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform, designed with a detailed breakdown of each component, utilizing React, Node.js, and AWS. The architecture aims to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure platform to manage the GSA Supply Catalog.

### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend is organized into modular components to enhance maintainability and scalability:
    - **Header Component**: Responsible for navigation and displaying user information.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Used for displaying the product catalog with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides detailed views for editing specific product information.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Allows users to upload CSV files with a drag-and-drop interface.
    - **ExportComponent**: Enables users to download product catalog data as a CSV file.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Selected for its comprehensive set of components and cohesive user experience.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal design standards, focusing on accessibility and usability.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV file uploads for validation before storing on S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves a list of products with options for sorting and filtering.
    - **POST**: Allows the addition of new products to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed information for a specific product.
    - **PUT**: Updates details of an existing product.
    - **DELETE**: Deletes a product from the catalog.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates an export of the product data to a CSV file and stores it on S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Managed using the **Multer** library to handle file uploads.
  - **Validations**: The **Joi** library ensures data integrity and verifies structure before processing.
  - **Background Processing**: **AWS Lambda** is used for resource-intensive tasks like CSV file validation, maintaining optimal performance asynchronously.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Handles deployment and management of Node.js applications with automatic scaling and monitoring capabilities.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Used for storing uploaded CSV files and exported data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Provides a managed, scalable, and secure relational database service.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages all API requests, providing routing, authorization, and request validation.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user identity, authentication, and authorization securely.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Integrated with **CodeBuild** and **CodeDeploy** for seamless continuous integration and deployment, ensuring automated and reliable application updates.
