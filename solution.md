### Detailed Explanation

**1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript):**

- **Component Structure**:
  - **Header**: Manages navigation across sections like CSV upload, catalog management, and export using `React Router`.
  - **CSVUploader**: Utilizes `react-dropzone` for file uploads. Communicates with `/uploadCSV` endpoint. Implements client-side validation with USWDS components for accessibility.
  - **CatalogViewer**: Provides search, pagination, and sorting features. Interacts with `/catalog` endpoint for data retrieval. Uses React's Context API for state management.
  - **ProductEditor**: Allows modifications of catalog entries through interaction with `/catalog/:id` endpoint.
  - **Footer**: Displays application version and contact details.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **USWDS**: Ensures accessibility and consistent UI design.
  - **Metrostar Comet**: Enhances interactivity for better user experience.

**2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL):**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **`POST /uploadCSV`**: Accepts and processes CSV uploads. Returns JSON response indicating success or failure.
  - **`GET /catalog`**: Retrieves catalog data in paginated format, incorporating query-based filtering and sorting.
  - **`PUT /catalog/:id`**: Updates catalog entries using JSON payload.
  - **`GET /catalog/download`**: Serves a downloadable CSV version of the catalog.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Managed by `Multer` middleware for uploads and `csv-parser` for CSV processing.
  - **Validations**: Implemented using `Joi` for data integrity enforcement.
  - **Background Processing**: Managed by `Bull` for asynchronous tasks like processing large CSV datasets.

**3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment:**

- **AWS Services**:
  - **Hosting**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application scaling and deployment.
  - **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for storing CSVs and static files.
  - **Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for stable data management.
  - **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway for request routing and management.
  - **Security**: Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization management.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: Automates build, test, and deployment, ensuring continuous integration and delivery based on code changes.

This architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and seamless integration with AWS services to meet the project's objectives.
