### Explanation

1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

   - **Component Structure**: 
     - The `CSVUploadComponent` manages file upload interactions and communicates with the backend through HTTP requests using `multipart/form-data`.
     - `CatalogTableComponent` provides a tabular view of the catalog with inline editing capabilities. It sends updates to the backend via RESTful API requests.
     - `CatalogExportComponent` allows users to export the catalog in different formats.

   - **UI Frameworks**:
     - **USWDS Components**: For all UI elements to adhere to accessibility standards required for government applications.
     - **Redux**: Used for managing global state to ensure consistent data sharing across components.
     - **React Router**: Enables SPA navigation, providing enhanced user experience.

2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

   - **RESTful API Endpoints**:
     - **/api/csv/upload**: 
       - **Method**: POST
       - **Request**: Requires HTTP form-data containing the CSV file.
       - **Response**: JSON object indicating success or failure with detailed error messages if necessary.
     - **/api/catalog/search**:
       - **Method**: GET
       - **Request**: JSON with search parameters.
       - **Response**: JSON array of catalog entries matching criteria.
     - **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**:
       - **Method**: PUT
       - **Request**: JSON payload with updated details.
       - **Response**: JSON indicating operation result.
     - **/api/catalog/export**:
       - **Method**: GET
       - **Request**: Query params specifying export format.
       - **Response**: File download in chosen format.

   - **Data Processing Workflows**:
     - Uploaded CSVs are temporarily stored in S3 with metadata recorded in PostgreSQL.
     - Data validation is performed using Joi.
     - Background processing with AWS Lambda is used for resource-intensive tasks, triggered by S3 events.

3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

   - **AWS Services**:
     - **Hosting**: The frontend is hosted on Amazon S3; CloudFront is used for low-latency global content delivery.
     - **Backend Deployment**: Managed through AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
     - **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for temporary and archived CSV files.
     - **Database**: PostgreSQL managed by Amazon RDS.
     - **API Management**: API Gateway for routing, versioning, and security.
     - **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager for confidential data, Cognito for user management.

   - **CI/CD Recommendations**:
     - Implement using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment, enhancing automated testing, building, and deployment triggered by code changes. 

This architecture structure ensures the application fulfills the business goals of scalability, maintainability, and security while providing a seamless experience for users managing the Global Supply catalog.
