Here is a structured technical architecture proposal based on the provided requirements. This architecture outlines the frontend, backend, AWS infrastructure, and deployment strategy, using the C4-PlantUML format.

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

- **Component Structure**: 
  - **App Component**: The central point for initializing the app with routing and theming functionalities.
  - **UploadComponent**: Manages CSV file uploads, interacts with the backend for file submission and user feedback.
  - **CatalogComponent**: Shows catalog data in a table, capable of searching, filtering, and sorting entries.
  - **EditComponent**: Facilitates editing of catalog entries, with validation and backend submission.
  - **ExportComponent**: Allows catalog download as CSV, communicating with backend services for file generation.
  - **UI Interaction**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls for data operations.

- **UI Frameworks/Libraries**: 
  - Use USWDS components for ensuring a consistent, accessible, and responsive UI, aligning with government design standards.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /upload**: Accepts CSV uploads, processes asynchronously, and returns a status message.
    - Request: `multipart/form-data` with CSV.
    - Response: JSON success/failure status.
  - **GET /catalog**: Retrieves catalog data with pagination and search options.
    - Request: Query parameters for pagination and search.
    - Response: JSON array of catalog data.
  - **POST /catalog/edit/:id**: Updates a catalog entry.
    - Request: JSON payload with updated fields.
    - Response: JSON confirmation of update.
  - **GET /export**: Triggers CSV download of catalog data.
    - Request: Optional filtering parameters.
    - Response: Streamed CSV file.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Store uploaded CSVs temporarily in S3 for scalability.
  - **Validations**: Validate CSVs against predefined schemas, checking for mandatory fields and correct data types.
  - **Background Processing**: Use AWS Lambda or an SQS-based Node.js worker for background processing of CSV files.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

- **AWS Services**:
  - **Hosting**: Elastic Beanstalk for the Node.js app, providing management and scaling.
  - **File Storage**: AWS S3 for CSV file storage and processing.
  - **Database**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for catalog data storage, offering high availability and backups.
  - **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway for API request handling, validation, and monitoring.
  - **Security**: Future integration with AWS Cognito for user management.

- **Deployment Details**:
  - Deploy frontend via AWS S3 and CloudFront for global content delivery.
  - Configure Elastic Beanstalk with load balancing for the Node.js backend.
  - Utilize Amazon RDS for secure database management.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations**:
  - Use AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for CI/CD, automating tests and deployments for the frontend and backend.
