Here is the detailed technical architecture developed based on the given requirements for a web application aimed at managing a supply catalog for the GSA Acquisition Workforce. The architecture is divided into frontend, backend, and AWS infrastructure components.

### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend is designed to be modular using React and TypeScript, ensuring scalability and maintainability through reusable components. Key components include:
    - **Header Component**: Manages application-wide navigation and user action items, linked through React Router for SPA experience.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays a comprehensive view of the product catalog, with functionalities for pagination, sorting, and filtering using hooks and context API.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Dedicated to viewing and editing product details, interfacing with the backend for CRUD operations.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Implements user-friendly drag-and-drop file upload, with progress indicators and error handling.
    - **ExportComponent**: Enables exporting the current view or entire catalog to CSV, integrated with backend endpoints for data retrieval.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Utilized for its comprehensive component library, customizable themes, and adherence to design principles.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with federal accessibility standards, offering a consistent and user-friendly experience.

### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - The API structure is RESTful, organized around key resources with endpoints such as:
    - **POST /api/upload**: Facilitates CSV file uploads, applying validation and storing the files in S3.
    - **GET /api/products**: Retrieves the product list, offering query parameters for pagination, sorting, and filtering.
    - **POST /api/products**: Adds new products to the catalog, performing necessary validation checks.
    - **GET/PUT/DELETE /api/products/:id**: Manages individual product details, providing operations to retrieve, update, or delete.
    - **GET /api/export**: Generates and retrieves a CSV export of the product catalog, interfacing with S3 for file management.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Uses the **Multer** middleware for handling file uploads, integrated with Express.
  - **Validation**: Employs **Joi** for both server-side and API input validation, ensuring data integrity.
  - **Background Processing**: Asynchronous tasks, particularly CSV parsing and validation, are managed through **AWS Lambda**, offloading processing to maintain responsiveness.

### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Chosen for its capability to automatically manage deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the Node.js application.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Designed for storing raw and processed CSV files, offering easy access and retrieval for downloads and persistence.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Provides a scalable, managed relational database service, ensuring high availability with built-in backups and patches.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Handles all REST API requests, providing routing, request validation, and security features like request throttling and authorization.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages authentication and authorization, offering seamless integration with frontend and backend components for secure access.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes using **AWS CodeBuild** and **CodeDeploy**, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
