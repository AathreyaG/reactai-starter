### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend follows a modular approach with React using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhancing code maintainability.
  - The application utilizes a container-presenter pattern:
    - **Header Component**: Manages application-wide navigation and logo.
    - **ProductList Component**: Facilitates viewing, filtering, and searching through products with pagination.
    - **ProductDetails Component**: Allows users to view and modify product details.
    - **CSVUpload Component**: Enables file uploads with pre-upload client-side validation.
    - **ExportButton Component**: Provides options to export data in CSV format.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Provides a comprehensive set of customizable UI components that ensure a consistent and responsive design.
  - **USWDS Components**: Used to comply with federal standards, ensuring accessibility and usability for federal users.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**: 
    - **POST** - Accepts CSV files, validates formats, and uploads to S3 before processing.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET** - Retrieves products with support for filtering and pagination. Returns data in JSON.
    - **POST** - Adds a new product entry to the database based on the JSON body.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET** - Retrieves detailed information for a specific product by ID.
    - **PUT** - Updates a product entry, supporting partial updates via JSON.
    - **DELETE** - Deletes a product by ID.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET** - Triggers the export of the product catalog as a CSV file, stored in Amazon S3.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - CSV uploads are handled with **Multer** for multipart form-data handling, with server-side validation via libraries like **Joi**.
  - **AWS Lambda** is used for background processing tasks such as file validations, ensuring they don't block the primary application flow.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is used for deploying the Node.js backend, providing load balancing, scaling, and easy configuration management.
- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3** acts as a storage solution for CSV files, ensuring durability and accessibility.
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL** handles data storage, offering automated backup and failover.
- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway** is employed for managing API lifecycles, applying rate limits, and securing API endpoints.
- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito** is implemented for managing user identities, supporting secure sign-in and sign-up.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline** automates the integration and deployment processes.
  - **AWS CodeBuild** for building and testing the application.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy** ensures automated code deployment with minimized downtime.
