Based on the given requirements and previous context, here's a comprehensive technical architecture plan for the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform, with a focus on leveraging AWS services and the specified tech stack.

### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The application follows a modular architecture, using React for building reusable components with TypeScript for type safety.
  - Key components include:
    - **Header Component**: Contains navigation links and branding.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays paginated product listings with filtering options.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides detailed views for individual product records with edit functionality.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Facilitates CSV file uploads with client-side validation using libraries like Formik and Yup.
    - **ExportComponent**: Triggers the download of catalog data in CSV format.

- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Offers a modern, consistent, and responsive design for UI components.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with US federal accessibility and design standards.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Accepts CSV files, performs server-side validation and uploads them to AWS S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Retrieves a list of products with support for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
    - **POST**: Allows for adding new product entries to the catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed information for a specific product by ID.
    - **PUT**: Updates the details of a product identified by ID.
    - **DELETE**: Removes a specific product from the catalog.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates the export process for product data into a CSV file and stores it in S3 for download.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Utilizes middleware like **Multer** for handling file uploads and **Joi** for JSON validation.
  - **Background Processing**: Employs **AWS Lambda** to handle asynchronous tasks such as CSV validation and processing without blocking the main application flow.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Manages the deployment and scaling of the Node.js application, providing ease of use with infrastructure management.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Offers scalable and secure storage for uploaded CSV files and exported data.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Provides a managed, durable, and scalable relational database service with high availability and backup options.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Facilitates secure and scalable exposure of RESTful APIs to the frontend application.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user identity, authentication, and access control securely.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
  - **AWS CodeBuild**: Handles code build and test tasks.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automates the deployment of applications to Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring reliable updates.
