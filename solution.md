Based on the given requirements, here is a detailed explanation of the proposed technical architecture for the web application:

### Detailed Architecture Explanation:

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**
- **Component Structure**: 
  - The frontend is built using a modular approach with reusable and encapsulated components.
    - **Header Component**: Provides navigation and user actions. It communicates with the backend to check user authentication status via API calls.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Displays a list of product catalogs with interactive features such as sorting, filtering, and pagination. It interacts with the backend to fetch and display product data.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Offers detailed information about a specific product and allows editing. Interacts with backend APIs to pull and push product data.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Manages file upload processes, including drag-and-drop functionality, upload progress tracking, and error reporting. Communicates with the backend to upload CSV files.
    - **ExportComponent**: Facilitates CSV export functionality by interacting with a backend endpoint to generate and download files.
- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**: 
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: For a rich set of components and theming capabilities.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures compliance with federal accessibility standards.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**
- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /api/upload**: Handles CSV file uploads. Expects multipart/form-data for CSV files and responds with upload status and any validation errors.
  - **GET /api/products**: Retrieves product data. Supports query parameters for pagination, sorting, and filtering. Responds with a JSON array of products.
  - **POST /api/products**: Adds new product entries. Expects JSON payload with product details and responds with the created product object or validation errors.
  - **GET/PUT/DELETE /api/products/:id**: Manages individual product entries. Handles retrieval, update, and deletion requests, responding with the relevant product object or status messages.
  - **GET /api/export**: Triggers CSV file generation from product data, with options for selecting specific data sets. Responds with a URL to download the generated file from S3.
- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Utilizes **Multer** middleware for handling file uploads in Express, saving temporary uploads to a local buffer before processing.
  - **Validation**: Utilizes **Joi** for comprehensive schema validation to ensure data integrity and conformity to required formats before database insertion.
  - **Background Processing**: AWS Lambda handles intensive or time-consuming tasks such as large CSV parsing. This keeps the main application server responsive and efficient.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**
- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Manages deployment, scaling, and monitoring of Node.js applications, providing an easy platform for application management.
- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Stores uploaded and processed CSV files, offering scalable storage solutions with reliability and availability.
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Provides a managed, scalable relational database service suitable for handling large datasets with high availability.
- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for API requests, managing routing, request validation, and authorization securely and efficiently.
- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Provides user authentication and identity management services, supporting secure sign-up, sign-in, and access control.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Facilitates the automation of building, testing, and deploying processes using **AWS CodeBuild** for builds and **AWS CodeDeploy** for deployments, ensuring robust CI/CD practices.
