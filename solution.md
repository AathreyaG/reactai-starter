### Explanation

1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

   - **Component Structure**: 
     - `CSVUploadComponent` manages file upload interactions using `multipart/form-data`.
     - `CatalogTableComponent` provides a tabular view of the catalog with inline editing and deletion capabilities.
     - `CatalogExportComponent` allows users to export the catalog in different formats.

   - **UI Frameworks**:
     - **USWDS Components**: Ensures accessibility standards for government applications.
     - **Redux**: Manages global state for consistent data sharing across components.
     - **React Router**: Enables SPA navigation for enhanced user experience.

2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

   - **RESTful API Endpoints**:
     - **/api/csv/upload**: Handles CSV file uploads.
     - **/api/catalog/search**: Retrieves catalog entries based on search criteria.
     - **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**: Updates catalog entries.
     - **/api/catalog/export**: Exports catalog data in specified formats.
     - **/api/catalog/delete/{id}**: Deletes a catalog entry.

   - **Data Processing Workflows**:
     - CSVs are temporarily stored in S3 with metadata in PostgreSQL.
     - Data validation is performed using Joi.
     - Background processing with AWS Lambda for resource-intensive tasks.

3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

   - **AWS Services**:
     - **Hosting**: Frontend on Amazon S3; CloudFront for global content delivery.
     - **Backend Deployment**: Managed through AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
     - **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for CSV files.
     - **Database**: PostgreSQL managed by Amazon RDS.
     - **API Management**: API Gateway for routing and security.
     - **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager for confidential data, Cognito for user management.

   - **CI/CD Recommendations**:
     - Implement using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment.

This refined architecture ensures the application supports catalog entry management, including deletion, while maintaining scalability, security, and a seamless user experience.
