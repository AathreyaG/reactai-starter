Here is a structured technical architecture for the web application based on the provided requirements. This architecture outlines the frontend, backend, AWS infrastructure, and deployment strategy, adhering to the C4-PlantUML format.

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

- **Component Structure**: 
  - **App Component**: The main entry point, responsible for initializing the application, routing, and theming.
  - **UploadComponent**: Handles CSV file uploads, providing user feedback and interacting with backend services for file submission.
  - **CatalogComponent**: Displays catalog data in a table format with capabilities for searching, filtering, and sorting of entries.
  - **EditComponent**: Allows editing of individual catalog entries, with data validation and submission to the backend.
  - **ExportComponent**: Facilitates downloading of the catalog as a CSV, interacting with backend services for file generation.
  - **UI Interaction**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls for uploading files, retrieving catalog data, and exporting catalogs.

- **UI Frameworks/Libraries**: 
  - Use USWDS components to ensure a consistent, accessible, and responsive user interface, aligning with government standards for design and usability.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /upload**: Accepts CSV files, performs asynchronous processing, and returns a status message.
    - Request: `multipart/form-data` with CSV file included.
    - Response: JSON object indicating success or failure status of upload.
  - **GET /catalog**: Returns catalog data with support for pagination and search.
    - Request: Query parameters for pagination and optional search filters.
    - Response: JSON array of catalog entries.
  - **POST /catalog/edit/:id**: Updates specific catalog entry.
    - Request: JSON payload with updated catalog fields.
    - Response: JSON object confirming the update status.
  - **GET /export**: Initiates the download of catalog data as a CSV file.
    - Request: Optional query parameters for filtering data to be exported.
    - Response: Streamed CSV file.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Uploaded CSV files are stored temporarily in an S3 bucket to ensure durability and scalability.
  - **Validations**: CSV files are checked for adherence to predefined schemas, including checks for mandatory fields and data types.
  - **Background Processing**: Use AWS Lambda functions or an SQS-based Node.js worker to process CSV files in the background, ensuring responsiveness and decoupled architecture.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

- **AWS Services**:
  - **Hosting**: Elastic Beanstalk for deploying the Node.js application, offering simplified management and scaling features.
  - **File Storage**: AWS S3 is utilized for storing uploaded CSV files and serving as a source for file processing.
  - **Database**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) is used to store catalog data, benefiting from high availability and automated backup capabilities.
  - **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway facilitates API request handling, including request validation, throttling, and monitoring.
  - **Security**: AWS Cognito can be integrated for user authentication and authorization, although not in the current MVP scope.

- **Deployment Details**:
  - Deploy frontend components using AWS S3 and Amazon CloudFront for efficient, globally distributed content delivery.
  - Set up Elastic Beanstalk with a load-balancer configuration for the Node.js backend to handle increased load and ensure high availability.
  - Leverage Amazon RDS for storing and managing database operations, ensuring data integrity and security.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations**:
  - Implement AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment processes, enabling automated testing and deployment of both frontend and backend services upon code changes.
