Based on the context provided and the requirements for the GSA Global Supply catalog web application, here is a detailed technical architecture plan using React with TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for the backend, all deployed on AWS infrastructure.

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

#### Component Structure:
- **Header**: Manages navigation using React Router for seamless user transitions between CSV uploads, catalog management, and exports.
- **CSVUploader**: Leverages `react-dropzone` for drag-and-drop file uploads. Communicates with the `/uploadCSV` backend endpoint for file submissions. Performs client-side validation using USWDS for consistent UI components.
- **CatalogViewer**: Displays the catalog data with features like search, pagination, and sorting. Interacts with the backend via the `/catalog` endpoint. Utilizes React Context API for state management.
- **ProductEditor**: Provides an interface for editing catalog entries, with changes sent to the backend through `/catalog/:id`.
- **Footer**: Shows static information like application version and contact details.

#### UI Frameworks/Component Libraries:
- **USWDS (United States Web Design System)**: Ensures accessibility and design uniformity.
- **Metrostar Comet**: Provides enhanced interactive UI components for a richer user experience.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

#### RESTful API Endpoints:
- **POST /uploadCSV**: Accepts file uploads, processes CSV files, and returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.
- **GET /catalog**: Returns catalog data in a paginated format. Supports query parameters for filtering and sorting.
- **PUT /catalog/:id**: Updates entries in the catalog database, expecting a JSON request body containing updated data.
- **GET /catalog/download**: Generates and returns the entire catalog as a downloadable CSV file.

#### Data Processing Workflows:
- **File Handling**: Uses `Multer` middleware for handling multipart form data and `csv-parser` for CSV file processing.
- **Validations**: Employs `Joi` to ensure data integrity before processing or storing.
- **Background Processing**: Utilizes `Bull` to manage asynchronous tasks, such as processing large CSV files in the background without blocking the main execution thread.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

#### AWS Services:
- **Hosting**: The application is hosted via AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which manages server scaling and load balancing.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 is used for storing uploaded CSV files and other static assets.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL provides managed, scalable, and reliable database services.
- **API Management**: API Gateway is used for routing and managing API requests, enhancing security and scalability.
- **Security**: Amazon Cognito handles user authentication and authorization with support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations:
- **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes. Changes in the codebase trigger the pipeline to ensure continuous integration and continuous delivery.
