To create a detailed, unambiguous, and structured technical architecture for the web application based on the given requirements and context, we will use the following structure:

### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

#### Component Structure:

- **Header**: 
  - This component will handle the navigation and it will use React Router for transitions between different sections such as CSV uploads, catalog management, and export functionalities.
  - The header ensures consistent user experience across the application.

- **CSVUploader**:
  - Uses `react-dropzone` for drag-and-drop file uploads.
  - Directly communicates with the backend through the `/uploadCSV` endpoint.
  - Performs client-side validation using USWDS components to ensure consistent and accessible UI.

- **CatalogViewer**:
  - Displays catalog data with functionalities like search, pagination, and sorting.
  - Communicates with the backend via the `/catalog` endpoint.
  - Uses Context API for state management to handle the global state conveniently.

- **ProductEditor**:
  - Provides a detailed interface for editing catalog entries.
  - Sends updates to the backend through `/catalog/:id` endpoint.

- **Footer**:
  - Displays static information such as application version and contact details.

#### UI Frameworks/Component Libraries:
- **USWDS**: Ensures accessibility, consistency, and government-standard UI.
- **Metrostar Comet**: Enhances interactive components for a better user experience.

### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

#### RESTful API Endpoints:
- **`POST /uploadCSV`**: 
  - Accepts CSV file uploads.
  - Processes files and returns JSON response indicating success or failure.
  
- **`GET /catalog`**: 
  - Fetches catalog data in a paginated format.
  - Supports filtering and sorting through query parameters.
  
- **`PUT /catalog/:id`**: 
  - Updates a catalog item identified by its unique ID.
  - Expects a JSON body with the fields to be updated.
  - Returns an appropriate response based on the outcome.

- **`GET /catalog/download`**: 
  - Generates a downloadable CSV file of the entire catalog.

#### Data Processing Workflows:
- **File Handling**: 
  - Uses `Multer` middleware for file uploads.
  - Employs `csv-parser` for processing CSV files.
  
- **Validations**: 
  - Ensures data integrity with `Joi`.
  
- **Background Processing**: 
  - Uses `Bull` for asynchronous tasks, such as processing large CSV data batches.

### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

#### AWS Services:
- **Hosting**: 
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk for running the application.
  
- **File Storage**: 
  - Amazon S3 for storing uploaded CSVs and static assets.
  
- **Database**: 
  - Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for reliable database management.
  
- **API Management**: 
  - Amazon API Gateway for managing API requests.
  
- **Security**: 
  - Amazon Cognito for handling user authentication and authorization.

#### Deployment Details:
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: 
  - Simplifies the deployment and scalability of the application.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: 
    - Automates build, test, and deployment processes.
    - Ensures continuous integration and delivery with triggers on code changes.
