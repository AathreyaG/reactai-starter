### Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)**

- **Component Structure**:
  - The frontend application is modular, using a component-based architecture to ensure reusability and manageability.
  - **Components** include:
    - **Header Component**: Central navigation and user information display.
    - **CatalogTable Component**: Presents the product catalog with capabilities for pagination, sorting, and filtering.
    - **ProductDetail Component**: Provides a detailed view for editing product specific information.
    - **CSVUploader Component**: Provides an interface allowing users to drag-and-drop and upload CSV files seamlessly.
    - **ExportComponent**: Allows users to download the catalog data in CSV format.
  
- **UI Frameworks/Component Libraries**:
  - **Material-UI (MUI)**: Selected for its extensive component library and ease of integration, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
  - **USWDS Components**: Ensures adherence to US federal design standards, which prioritize accessibility and usability.

#### 2. **Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)**

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **/api/upload**:
    - **POST**: Facilitates CSV file uploads for initial validation before storing on S3.
  - **/api/products**:
    - **GET**: Offers product listings with optional features for sorting and filtering.
    - **POST**: Supports adding new entries to the product catalog.
  - **/api/products/:id**:
    - **GET**: Fetches detailed data for a specific product.
    - **PUT**: Permits updates to existing product details.
    - **DELETE**: Allows for the removal of a product.
  - **/api/export**:
    - **GET**: Initiates a CSV export of the current product data, then stores the files in S3 for retrieval.

- **Data Processing Workflows**:
  - **File Handling**: Managed using **Multer**, facilitating smooth file uploads and CSV handling.
  - **Validations**: Ensures data integrity using the **Joi** library for structured validation.
  - **Background Processing**: Utilizes **AWS Lambda** to handle resource-intensive tasks like file validations asynchronously to optimize response times.

#### 3. **AWS Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Hosting**:
  - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Manages deployment, scaling, and health monitoring of the Node.js applications automatically.

- **File Storage**:
  - **Amazon S3**: Provides highly durable storage solutions for managing uploaded CSV files and exporting operations.

- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL**: Ensures secure, scalable, and reliable database management using a managed service.

- **API Management**:
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Centralizes API request handling, with built-in security and validation features.

- **Security**:
  - **Amazon Cognito**: Provides a robust platform for managing user identities, authentication, and authorization.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Facilitates a complete CI/CD solution, incorporating CodeBuild and CodeDeploy to streamline deployment workflows.

This architecture is designed to ensure that the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform achieves scalability, efficiency, and ease of maintenance, aligned with standard industry practices and compliance requirements.
