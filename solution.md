Sure, let's break down the technical architecture for this web application using the C4 model to provide a detailed overview of frontend and backend components, AWS infrastructure, and deployment recommendations. 

### Detailed Components Explanation

#### 1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

**Component Structure and UI Interaction:**

- **MainComponents**:
  - **CSVUploadComponent**: Manages file selection and uploads via a form interface. Interaction with the backend is handled using HTTP requests in `multipart/form-data` format.
  - **CatalogTableComponent**: Presents catalog entries in a tabular format. It's designed to support inline editing, triggering RESTful API calls to update entries.
  - **CatalogExportComponent**: Offers functionality to export catalog data, allowing users to request downloads.

**State Management and UI Framework:**

- **Redux**: Facilitates centralized state management, enabling efficient data flow between components and consistent application state.
- **React Router**: Ensures seamless navigation for a single-page application (SPA) experience without reloading the page.
- **USWDS Components**: Incorporates design standards that ensure compliance with accessibility norms pertinent to government applications.

#### 2. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

- **/api/csv/upload**:
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Request**: HTTP form-data with CSV file upload.
  - **Response**: JSON indicating operation success or failure.
  
- **/api/catalog/search**:
  - **Method**: GET
  - **Request**: JSON with search parameters.
  - **Response**: JSON array containing search results.

- **/api/catalog/edit/{id}**:
  - **Method**: PUT
  - **Request**: JSON payload of updated catalog entry.
  - **Response**: JSON result of the update operation.

- **/api/catalog/export**:
  - **Method**: GET
  - **Request**: Query parameters for format selection.
  - **Response**: File download in requested format.

**Data Processing Workflows:**

- **File Handling**: CSV files are uploaded and stored temporarily in an S3 bucket. Metadata is stored in PostgreSQL for tracking.
- **Data Validation**: Utilizes the Joi library to enforce schema validation, ensuring that only well-formed data is processed.
- **Background Processing**: AWS Lambda is leveraged to run intensive data processing tasks asynchronously, thus offloading processing from the main server.

#### 3. AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**AWS Services Used:**

- **Hosting**: Frontend assets deployed to Amazon S3, with distribution managed by CloudFront for global reach.
- **Backend Deployment**: Uses AWS Elastic Beanstalk, providing a managed service for scaling Node.js applications.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 serves as the file storage solution for uploaded CSVs and resultant exports.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS hosts PostgreSQL, ensuring a robust database with automatic backups and scaling options.
- **API Management**: API Gateway is employed for API versioning, request throttling, and security enforcement.
- **Security**: Secrets Manager delivers secure handling of sensitive configuration data, while Cognito handles user authentication, issuance of OAuth2 tokens, etc.

**CI/CD Recommendations:**

- Set up AWS CodePipeline integrated with CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment, allowing automated testing, building, and deployment processes to be triggered by code changes.
