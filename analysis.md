### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data via a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search for specific products and edit their details.
  - **Download/Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**:
  - A web interface is required for uploading CSV files, searching, editing, and downloading/publishing catalogs.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - The tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

- **Team Composition**:
  - Two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and follows the provided sample structure.
- The application will initially support only CSV file uploads.
- User authentication and authorization are not required for the MVP.
- The application will not handle concurrent file uploads in the MVP.
- The catalog data will be stored in a Postgres database.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- The specific requirements for the search functionality (e.g., search by which fields).
- The exact process and requirements for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- The size and complexity of the CSV files that need to be handled.
- Any specific UI/UX requirements beyond basic functionality.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend (React + USWDS)**:
   - Implement a basic web interface with:
     - A file upload component for CSV files.
     - A simple search bar to filter products by NSN or common name.
     - A table to display uploaded product data.
   
2. **Backend (Node.js + Sequelize + Postgres)**:
   - Set up a basic RESTful API to:
     - Accept CSV file uploads and parse the data.
     - Store parsed data in a Postgres database.
     - Retrieve product data for display and search.
     - Allow editing of product details.

3. **Platform (AWS)**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using a simple architecture (e.g., EC2 or AWS Lambda for the backend, S3 for static assets).

### Stretch Goal

- Implement download functionality for the catalog.
- Add basic editing capabilities to the frontend to update product details.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading and displaying CSV data.
- A backend API for handling CSV uploads and data retrieval.
- A Postgres database schema for storing product data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage of the application.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

- What are the specific fields and criteria for the search functionality?
- Are there any specific requirements for the UI/UX design?
- What is the expected size and complexity of the CSV files?
- Are there any specific security or compliance requirements for the application?
