### Detailed Explanation of the Problem

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce that allows seamless upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Functionalities**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Export and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Users interact with the application through a web interface.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and follows the sample structure provided.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will be deployed on AWS, leveraging the tech stack provided.
- The MVP will focus on core functionalities without advanced features like user authentication or detailed analytics.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: The problem statement does not clarify if different user roles exist and how permissions are managed.
- **Publishing Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage are not provided.
- **Error Handling**: The problem statement does not specify how to handle errors during upload, search, or publication.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload Interface**:
   - Develop a simple web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Implement backend logic using Node.js and Sequelize to parse and store CSV data in a Postgres database.

2. **Catalog Search and Edit**:
   - Implement a basic search functionality using RESTful APIs to query the database.
   - Allow users to edit product details directly from the search results.

3. **Download Catalog**:
   - Provide an option to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Publish to GSA Marketplaces**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to publish the catalog to a mock endpoint representing GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for CSV file upload.
- Backend services for parsing and storing CSV data.
- Search functionality for the product catalog.
- Edit functionality for product details.
- Option to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Basic documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
4. How should errors be handled and communicated to the user during upload, search, or publication?

This plan focuses on delivering the core functionalities within the given time constraints, with a stretch goal to extend capabilities if time permits.
