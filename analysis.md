### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop a web application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data, with a maximum file size of 100 MB.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search and edit the product catalog.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV file with columns: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC, and an additional date column.

- **User Interface**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Interface for searching, editing, and managing product data.

- **Assumptions**:
  - The CSV files are well-formed and adhere to the specified format.
  - User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
  - The application will initially support only the English language.
  - Error handling for CSV upload (e.g., incorrect format) is minimal in MVP.

- **Uncertainties/Ambiguities**:
  - Specifics on how the publication to GSA marketplaces should be handled.
  - Details on user roles and permissions, if any.
  - The extent of editing capabilities (e.g., which fields can be edited).
  - How large file sizes are handled and any performance considerations.

### MVP Plan

- **Frontend**:
  - Develop a simple React-based web interface for CSV upload.
  - Implement a basic search functionality using React components.
  - Create a simple form for editing product details.

- **Backend**:
  - Set up a Node.js server with Express to handle CSV uploads.
  - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database to store product data.
  - Implement RESTful APIs for searching and editing product data.

- **Platform**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS using services like EC2 or Lambda.
  - Ensure basic security measures are in place (e.g., HTTPS).

- **Stretch Goal**:
  - Implement the download functionality for the catalog.
  - Begin integration with GSA marketplaces for publishing.

### Deliverables

- **Frontend**:
  - React components for CSV upload, search, and edit functionality.

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js server with RESTful APIs for CSV processing, search, and edit operations.
  - Postgres database schema for storing product data.

- **Platform**:
  - Deployed application on AWS.
  - Basic documentation for deployment and usage.

### Questions for Improving MVP

1. What are the specific requirements for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces?
2. Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints for handling large CSV files?
3. Should there be any user authentication or authorization features in the MVP?
4. Is there a need for detailed error handling and validation for CSV uploads in the MVP?
