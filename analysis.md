### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Functionality Requirements**:
  - **Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search for specific products and edit the catalog entries.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog and publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data**:
  - The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - The catalog contains over 2.5 million items, indicating the need for efficient data handling and storage.

- **User Interface**:
  - A web-based interface for uploading, searching, editing, downloading, and publishing the catalog.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - APIs: RESTful APIs
  - Language: TypeScript

### Assumptions

- The application will initially support CSV file uploads only.
- The application will be accessible to authorized federal buyers and GSA personnel.
- The MVP will focus on core functionalities: upload, search, edit, and download.
- Publishing to GSA marketplaces will be a stretch goal due to time constraints.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Authentication**: Details on user authentication and authorization are not provided.
- **Publishing Mechanism**: The process for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Data Validation**: Requirements for data validation during upload are not specified.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend (React, USWDS components)**:
   - Implement a basic UI for CSV upload.
   - Create a simple search and edit interface for catalog entries.
   - Develop a download button for the catalog.

2. **Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)**:
   - Set up a database schema to store catalog data.
   - Implement RESTful APIs for upload, search, edit, and download functionalities.

3. **Platform (AWS)**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.

4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct basic testing for upload, search, edit, and download functionalities.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the publishing feature to GSA marketplaces, focusing on the integration with FedMall or GSA Advantage.

### Deliverables

- Basic web interface for CSV upload, search, edit, and download.
- RESTful APIs for handling catalog operations.
- Database schema and setup for storing catalog data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for MVP Improvement

1. What are the specific file size limits for CSV uploads?
2. What authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented?
3. Are there specific data validation rules for the CSV data?
4. Can we get more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
