### Detailed Analysis of the Problem Statement

- **Objective:** Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to facilitate the upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features:**
  - **CSV File Upload:** Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data through a web interface, with a size limit of 100MB.
  - **Catalog Management:** Users need the ability to search, edit, download, and publish product catalogs.
  - **Integration with Marketplaces:** The application must support publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure:**
  - Each product is identified by a unique National Stock Number (NSN).
  - CSV files include fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Users will interact with the application via a web interface.
  - The interface should support varying file sizes for upload.

- **Technical Stack:**
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - APIs: RESTful

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and standardized as per the sample provided.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially be developed for internal use by the GSA Acquisition Workforce.
- The MVP will focus on core functionalities without advanced features like user authentication or detailed analytics.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits:** The maximum size of CSV files that can be uploaded is now specified as 100MB.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** It's unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publishing Process:** The exact process and requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Error Handling:** There is no mention of how errors in file uploads or data processing should be handled.

### MVP Plan

- **Frontend:**
  - Develop a simple React-based interface for CSV file upload.
  - Implement basic search and edit functionality for the catalog.
  - Use USWDS components for UI consistency.

- **Backend:**
  - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling file uploads and catalog management.
  - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database for storing catalog data.
  - Implement basic validation for CSV data.

- **Platform:**
  - Deploy the application on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the functionality to publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces, focusing on one platform (e.g., GSA Advantage) as a proof of concept.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV file upload and catalog management.
- RESTful APIs for backend operations, including file upload, search, and edit functionalities.
- A Postgres database schema for storing catalog data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Basic documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. Are there different user roles with specific permissions?
2. Can we get more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
3. What are the error handling requirements for file uploads and data processing?
