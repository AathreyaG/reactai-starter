### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface. The files can vary in size.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export/Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - Each product is uniquely identified by its NSN.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Users interact with the application via a web interface.
  - Users need the ability to search and edit entries in the catalog.

- **Integration**:
  - The application should integrate with platforms like FedMall and GSA Advantage for publishing.

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English.
- Publishing to external platforms is a simple export process, not requiring complex API integrations for the MVP.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **Search and Edit Functionality**: The specific search criteria and edit capabilities are not detailed.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact method of publishing to GSA marketplaces is not described.
- **User Roles**: It is unclear if different user roles have different permissions.

### MVP Plan

#### Frontend (React, USWDS components)

- **CSV Upload Interface**: 
  - Simple form to upload CSV files.
  - Display upload status and any errors.

- **Catalog Display**:
  - Basic table to display catalog entries.
  - Search functionality by NSN or common_name.

#### Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)

- **CSV Processing**:
  - Endpoint to handle CSV file upload and parse data.
  - Store parsed data in a Postgres database.

- **Catalog Management**:
  - RESTful API to fetch, search, and update catalog entries.

- **Export Functionality**:
  - Endpoint to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

#### Platform (AWS)

- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS using a simple EC2 instance or AWS Lambda for serverless processing.

### Stretch Goal

- **Edit Functionality**: Allow users to edit catalog entries directly from the web interface.
- **Basic Authentication**: Implement simple user authentication to restrict access to authorized users only.

### Deliverables

- CSV upload interface on the frontend.
- Backend API to process and store CSV data.
- Basic catalog display with search functionality.
- Export endpoint for downloading the catalog.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

1. What is the maximum expected size of the CSV files?
2. Are there any specific search criteria or filters required beyond NSN and common_name?
3. What is the expected method for publishing to GSA marketplaces? Is it a file export or API integration?
4. Are there any user roles or permissions that need to be considered for the MVP?
