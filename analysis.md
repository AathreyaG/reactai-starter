### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users must have the capability to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: The entire catalog should be downloadable and publishable to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: 
  - The CSV contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - Each product is uniquely identified by an NSN.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Interface for searching and editing catalog entries.
  - Option to download or publish the catalog.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: React, USWDS components.
  - **Backend**: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres.
  - **Platform**: AWS for deployment.
  - **APIs**: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend.

### Assumptions

- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The CSV format is consistent and validated before processing.
- The application will initially target a single marketplace for publication.
- Security and authentication are handled outside the scope of this MVP.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: No specific size limits are mentioned for the CSV files.
- **Publication Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not provided.
- **User Roles**: Unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Error Handling**: No specifics on how errors during upload or processing should be managed.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours)

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a basic React interface for CSV upload.
   - Implement a simple search and edit interface using USWDS components.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling CSV uploads and catalog management.
   - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database for storing catalog data.

3. **Platform Setup**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.

4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct basic testing for CSV upload and data retrieval.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the download functionality for the catalog.
- Begin integration for publishing the catalog to a GSA marketplace.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV upload and basic catalog management.
- Node.js backend with RESTful APIs for handling catalog operations.
- Postgres database schema for storing catalog data.
- AWS deployment of the application.
- Basic documentation of the application setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

1. What are the specific size limits for CSV uploads, if any?
2. Can we get more details on the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
3. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
4. What are the expected error handling and logging requirements?
