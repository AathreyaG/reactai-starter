### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Core Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface. The file upload has a maximum limit of 100MB.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export/Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV file with fields: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  - Example provided with two product entries.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web-based interface for uploading, searching, editing, and publishing catalogs.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.
  - Team consists of two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- Users have access to the web interface and necessary permissions to upload and manage catalogs. No user authentication is required.
- The CSV format is consistent and validated before processing.
- The application will initially support only the features outlined without additional integrations.
- The application will be hosted on AWS, leveraging its services for deployment and scalability.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- Specifics of the user roles and permissions for accessing different features.
- Details on how the publication to GSA marketplaces should be handled.
- Requirements for data validation and error handling during CSV upload.
- The extent of search and edit functionalities (e.g., search by all fields, edit all fields).
- Performance expectations for handling large CSV files.

### MVP Plan

**Frontend (React, USWDS components)**
- Implement a simple UI for CSV upload.
- Create a basic search interface for catalog entries.
- Develop a simple form for editing catalog entries.

**Backend (Node.js, TypeScript, Sequelize, Postgres)**
- Set up a RESTful API for handling CSV uploads and storing data in Postgres.
- Implement endpoints for searching and editing catalog entries.
- Create a basic endpoint for exporting the catalog data.

**Platform (AWS)**
- Deploy the application on AWS with basic scalability and reliability configurations.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Add more advanced search and filtering capabilities.
- Enhance the UI for better user experience and accessibility.
- Implement data validation and error handling for CSV uploads.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV upload, search, and edit functionalities.
- Backend API for handling data operations.
- Basic deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
- Stretch goal features if time permits.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What are the specific user roles and permissions required for the application?
2. Are there any specific requirements for the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
3. What are the expected performance metrics for handling large CSV files?
4. Should there be any specific data validation rules for the CSV upload?
