### Detailed Analysis of the Problem Statement

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce that allows seamless upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files with varying file sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Search functionality for product catalogs.
  - Editing capabilities for product details.
  - Options to download or publish catalogs.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - Database: Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - Language: TypeScript

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format and structure are consistent and standardized as per the sample provided.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially be deployed on AWS.
- The system will handle basic error handling and validation for CSV uploads.
- The application will be accessed by federal buyers or authorized personnel only.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- Specific requirements for the search and edit functionalities (e.g., filters, search criteria).
- Details on how the publication process to GSA marketplaces should be handled.
- Performance requirements for handling large CSV files.
- Security measures and compliance requirements for handling sensitive data.
- User roles and permissions for accessing different features of the application.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend (React, USWDS components)**:
   - Implement a basic web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Display a simple list view of the uploaded catalog data.

2. **Backend (Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize)**:
   - Set up a basic Node.js server with endpoints for uploading CSV files.
   - Implement a service to parse CSV files and store data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

3. **Database (Postgres)**:
   - Design a simple schema to store the catalog data based on the CSV structure.

4. **Platform (AWS)**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Ensure basic validation for CSV uploads (e.g., file format, required fields).

### Stretch Goal

- Implement a basic search functionality to filter catalog items by NSN or common name.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Backend services for handling CSV uploads and storing data.
- A database schema for storing catalog information.
- Basic deployment on AWS.
- Documentation on how to use the application and upload CSV files.
- A simple search functionality for catalog items (stretch goal).
