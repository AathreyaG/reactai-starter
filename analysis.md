### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application to upload, curate, and publish the GSA Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users must be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface, with a maximum file size of 200MB.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Publishing and Downloading**: Users should have the ability to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
  - **Authentication**: Keycloak authentication is required.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Each product is identified by a unique National Stock Number (NSN).
  - Sample CSV data includes fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - A web-based interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Functionality for searching and editing catalog entries.
  - Options for downloading or publishing the catalog.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will initially support only the features listed in the problem statement.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **User Roles and Permissions**: It's unclear if different user roles will have different permissions.
- **Publishing Mechanism**: The exact process for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: Details on how to handle errors during upload, search, edit, and publish processes are not provided.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.
   - Store uploaded data in a Postgres database using Sequelize ORM.

2. **Catalog Search and Edit**:
   - Develop a search functionality using React and Node.js to query the Postgres database.
   - Allow users to edit catalog entries and update the database.

3. **Download Feature**:
   - Implement a feature to download the catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineer's expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the publishing functionality to GSA marketplaces, assuming the process is clarified.

### Deliverables

- **CSV Upload Interface**: A web page for uploading CSV files.
- **Catalog Management**: Search and edit functionality for catalog entries.
- **Download Functionality**: Ability to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- **Deployment**: Application deployed on AWS.
- **Documentation**: Basic user guide and technical documentation for the MVP.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any specific user roles or permissions that need to be implemented?
- How should errors be handled and communicated to the user?
