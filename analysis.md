### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users can upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users can search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export/Publish**: Users can download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- **Data Structure**: The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
- **User Interface**: The application should have a user-friendly interface for uploading files and managing catalog data.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only CSV files for upload.
- The application will be web-based and accessible through a browser.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify any limits.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: It is unclear what specific roles and permissions users will have.
- **Publishing Mechanism**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not provided.
- **Error Handling**: The problem statement does not specify how errors in file upload or data processing should be handled.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Validate the CSV format and handle errors during upload.
   - Store uploaded data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Catalog Search and Edit**:
   - Implement a basic search functionality to find products by NSN or common name.
   - Allow users to edit product details directly in the application.

3. **Download Catalog**:
   - Provide an option to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Basic UI**:
   - Use React and USWDS components to create a simple, intuitive user interface.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement a basic publish feature that simulates publishing the catalog to a mock GSA marketplace endpoint.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Backend services for processing and storing catalog data.
- Basic search and edit functionality for catalog items.
- Option to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Documentation on how to use the application and any assumptions made.
- A simple publish simulation feature (stretch goal).

### Questions for Improvement

1. What are the specific file size limits for CSV uploads?
2. Can we assume a single user role for the MVP, or do we need to implement role-based access control?
3. Are there any specific requirements for the publish feature, such as integration with existing GSA systems?
4. How should errors be communicated to the user during file upload or data processing?
