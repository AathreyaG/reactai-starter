### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Core Features**:
  - **Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search for products and edit the catalog entries.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog and publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**: A web-based interface is required for interaction with the application.

- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - APIs: RESTful APIs
  - Language: TypeScript

- **Team Composition**:
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and standardized across uploads.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only CSV file uploads.
- The application will be deployed on AWS, leveraging its services for hosting and storage.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **Publishing Mechanism**: The exact method for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Search Functionality**: The scope of search capabilities (e.g., full-text search, filter options) is not specified.
- **Editing Capabilities**: Details on what fields can be edited and how changes are tracked are not provided.
- **User Roles**: Different user roles and permissions are not mentioned.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a basic React application using USWDS components.
   - Implement a file upload component to handle CSV uploads.
   - Develop a simple search interface to query the catalog.
   - Display catalog entries in a tabular format with options to edit inline.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful API endpoints for file upload, search, and edit functionalities.
   - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database for storing catalog data.
   - Implement basic CSV parsing and data validation logic.

3. **Platform Engineering**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS, using services like S3 for file storage and EC2 or Lambda for hosting the application.
   - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the download functionality to allow users to export the catalog as a CSV file.
- Begin work on the publishing mechanism to GSA marketplaces, if time permits.

### Deliverables

- A functional web application with:
  - CSV file upload capability.
  - Basic search and edit functionalities.
  - Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
- A brief report on potential improvements and next steps for further development.
