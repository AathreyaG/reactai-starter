### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - The application should support varying file sizes for uploads.
  - Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Details**:
  - The CSV contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - The catalog includes over 2.5 million items.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - The team has expertise in React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.
  - The team consists of two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV upload feature should handle large files efficiently.
- The search functionality should be optimized for quick retrieval of data.
- The application should have a user-friendly interface for editing catalog entries.
- Publishing to GSA marketplaces might involve integration with external systems.
- Security and data integrity are crucial, given the nature of the data.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- Specific requirements for integration with FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- The exact format and validation rules for the CSV files.
- User authentication and authorization details.
- Performance expectations for large-scale data handling.
- Error handling and logging requirements.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend (React & USWDS)**
   - Develop a basic UI for CSV upload and display a list of uploaded items.
   - Implement a simple search functionality to filter items by NSN or common name.

2. **Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)**
   - Set up a basic API to handle CSV uploads and store data in a Postgres database.
   - Implement endpoints for searching and retrieving catalog data.

3. **Platform (AWS)**
   - Deploy a simple application setup on AWS, ensuring basic scalability and reliability.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement a basic editing feature for catalog entries.
- Develop a simple download functionality to export the catalog as a CSV.
- Begin integration planning for publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files and displaying catalog items.
- Backend API to handle data storage and retrieval.
- Basic search functionality for catalog items.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What are the specific requirements for CSV validation?
2. Are there any specific performance benchmarks we need to meet?
3. What are the security requirements for handling and storing the catalog data?
4. Can we get more details on the integration requirements with GSA marketplaces?
