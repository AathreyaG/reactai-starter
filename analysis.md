### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog to platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users must have the ability to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Current Offerings**: Over 2.5 million items are available, indicating the need for efficient handling of large datasets.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format and structure are consistent and standardized.
- User authentication and authorization are not explicitly mentioned but are assumed to be necessary for secure access.
- The application will be web-based, given the mention of a web interface.
- Publishing to GSA marketplaces involves a standardized API or method, though specifics are not provided.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The term "varying file sizes" is vague. Clarification is needed on the maximum file size that can be handled.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact method or API for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: There is no mention of different user roles or permissions, which could affect access to certain features.
- **Error Handling**: Details on how errors in CSV uploads or data processing should be handled are not provided.

### MVP Plan

**Objective**: Develop a minimal viable product that allows CSV upload, basic search, and download functionality.

#### Tasks

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a frontend interface using React for file upload.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.
   - Store uploaded data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Search Functionality**:
   - Implement a simple search feature using React on the frontend.
   - Use RESTful APIs to query the database for search results.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Allow users to download the catalog as a CSV file.
   - Implement this feature using Node.js to generate and serve the CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Use AWS for hosting the application.
   - Ensure the application is accessible and functional.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Edit Functionality**: Allow users to edit product details directly from the application interface.
- **Publish Functionality**: Implement a basic integration with a mock API to simulate publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A web-based application with:
  - CSV upload capability.
  - Basic search functionality.
  - CSV download capability.
- A deployed application on AWS.
- Documentation on how to use the application and any setup required.
- A basic architecture diagram outlining the system components and data flow.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected size of the CSV files?
2. Are there any specific security requirements for user authentication and data access?
3. Can we get access to a sample API or documentation for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there specific error handling or logging requirements we should be aware of?
