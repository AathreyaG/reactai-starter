### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce that allows users to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users must be able to upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users must be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**: The application should have a user-friendly web interface for uploading files and managing the catalog.

- **Integration**: The application must integrate with platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage for publishing catalogs.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and standardized.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only CSV file uploads.
- The application will be hosted on AWS, utilizing the tech stack provided (React, Node.js, etc.).

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits or performance expectations.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact method of publishing to FedMall or GSA Advantage is not detailed.
- **User Authentication**: The problem statement does not specify how users will be authenticated or authorized.
- **Data Validation**: There is no mention of data validation rules for the CSV files.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Backend API using Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in a Postgres database.

2. **Basic Search Functionality**:
   - Implement a search feature using Sequelize to query the Postgres database for specific NSN entries.

3. **Basic Edit Functionality**:
   - Allow users to edit entries directly from the web interface and update the database.

4. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the current catalog as a CSV file.

5. **Basic UI Design**:
   - Use USWDS components to ensure a consistent and accessible design.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publish Functionality**:
  - Implement a basic integration with a mock FedMall or GSA Advantage API to simulate the publishing process.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV uploads.
- Backend API for handling uploads, searches, and edits.
- Basic search and edit functionality.
- CSV download feature.
- Documentation on how to use the application.
- Deployment on AWS with basic CI/CD setup.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for publishing to FedMall or GSA Advantage?
- Are there any specific performance requirements for handling large CSV files?
- What are the authentication and authorization requirements for the application?
- Are there any specific data validation rules for the CSV files?
