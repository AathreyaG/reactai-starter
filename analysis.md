### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - Allow varying file sizes for upload.
  - Enable searching and editing of product catalogs.
  - Allow downloading or publishing of the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV file with columns: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  - Example data provided for understanding the structure.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Features for searching and editing catalog entries.
  - Options to download or publish the catalog.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Use of specified tech stack: React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

- **Team Composition**:
  - Two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- Specific file size limits for CSV uploads.
- Detailed user roles and permissions.
- Exact publishing mechanism to GSA marketplaces.
- Handling of CSV upload errors and data validation.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a basic React web interface for CSV upload.
   - Implement a simple search functionality for catalog entries.
   - Display catalog entries in a tabular format using USWDS components.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful API endpoints for:
     - Uploading CSV files.
     - Searching catalog entries.
   - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database for storing catalog data.

3. **Platform Engineering**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS.
   - Ensure basic security measures and configurations are in place.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement editing functionality for catalog entries.
- Add download functionality for the entire catalog.
- Begin integration for publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV upload and basic search.
- Node.js RESTful API for handling CSV uploads and search queries.
- Postgres database setup with Sequelize for data storage.
- AWS deployment of the application.
- Basic documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any specific CSV validation rules we need to implement?
- What are the user roles and permissions that need to be considered?
- Is there a preferred method for handling large file uploads?
