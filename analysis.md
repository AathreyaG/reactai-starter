### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product information.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.
  
- **Data Format**: 
  - CSV files with columns: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  
- **Current Catalog Size**: Over 2.5 million items.

- **User Interface**: A web interface for uploading and managing the catalog.

- **Tech Stack**: React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file structure is consistent and follows the provided sample format.
- The application will initially support only CSV file uploads.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.
- The focus is on functionality rather than extensive UI/UX design.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **User Roles**: It's unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact mechanism for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: How errors in file uploads or data processing should be handled is not specified.
- **Data Validation**: The level of data validation required for the CSV content.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP
1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Backend API to handle file uploads and parse CSV data.
   - Store parsed data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Search and Edit Functionality**:
   - Basic search functionality to query the catalog based on NSN or common name.
   - Simple edit interface to update product details.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Allow users to download the current catalog as a CSV file.

#### Stretch Goal
- **Publish Functionality**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to simulate publishing the catalog to a marketplace.

### Deliverables

- **Frontend**:
  - React components for CSV upload, search, and edit interfaces.
  - Basic styling using USWDS components.

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js API endpoints for file upload, search, edit, and download.
  - Integration with Postgres using Sequelize for data storage.

- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS.
  - Ensure basic CI/CD pipeline for deployment.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles or permissions that need to be implemented?
3. What is the expected format or protocol for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there any specific data validation rules for the CSV content?
5. Should the application support any other file formats besides CSV in the future?
