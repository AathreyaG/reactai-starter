### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publishing**: Users should be able to download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Sample Data**: The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - Language: TypeScript
  - APIs: RESTful

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format and structure are consistent and standardized as shown in the sample.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only the specified platforms (FedMall and GSA Advantage).
- The application will handle basic CSV validation (e.g., correct headers, data types).

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The exact limits of "varying file sizes" are not specified.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Details on user roles and permissions are not provided.
- **Publishing Process**: The method and requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: Specifics on how errors (e.g., upload failures, validation errors) should be communicated to users are not mentioned.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours)

- **Frontend**:
  - Implement a basic React interface for CSV file upload.
  - Display a simple table to show uploaded CSV data.
  - Allow basic search functionality within the displayed data.

- **Backend**:
  - Set up a Node.js server with endpoints for CSV upload and data retrieval.
  - Implement basic CSV parsing and validation using Node.js.
  - Store parsed data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

- **Platform**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.
  - Ensure the application is accessible and functional for internal testing.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement basic edit functionality for catalog items.
- Add download functionality for the catalog in CSV format.
- Begin integration with GSA marketplaces for publishing.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV upload and data display.
- A Node.js backend with endpoints for handling CSV uploads and data retrieval.
- A Postgres database schema to store catalog data.
- Basic AWS deployment for internal testing.
- Documentation on how to upload, search, and view catalog data.
- A list of identified issues or potential improvements for future development.
