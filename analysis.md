### Detailed Analysis of the Problem Statement

- **Objective Overview:**
  - Develop a digital enrollment platform for AltantisGate to handle at least 100K applicants per month, with provisions for surge capacity.
  - Implement a flashy enrollment site with real-time public enrollment counters.
  - Create a customizable workflow engine for processing applicants.
  - Develop an automated intelligent scheduling assistant for assimilation across multiple sites.
  - Provide a mobile proof of concept app using a low-code/no-code platform.

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Applicant Portal:**
    - Submission of information via the A-9000 form.
    - Scheduling and tracking of enrollment.
    - Notifications for status updates.
  - **Internal Business User Portal:**
    - Dashboard for processing times, queues, and scheduling.
    - Ability to adjust resources and change workflows.
  - **Internal Business Supervisor Portal:**
    - Approve applicant enrollments for scheduling.
  - **DevSecOps Requirements:**
    - AWS environment setup with CI/CD pipeline.
    - Automated security scans and code testing.
    - Infrastructure setup using automated scripts.
    - Implementation of a configurable workflow engine.
    - Automated scheduling assistant for assimilation.

- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Use of AWS FedRAMP services, open-source/free software.
  - Development team specialization in React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The enrollment process will be based on the US DHS USCIS agency model.
  - All applicants will be granted access, so the focus is on processing efficiency.
  - The mobile app is a proof of concept and does not need full functionality.

- **Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity:**
  - Specific data formats and irregularities in the immigration information.
  - Exact surge capacity requirements beyond the 100K baseline.
  - Details on the flashy design requirements for the enrollment site.
  - Customization options for the workflow engine.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

- **Frontend Development:**
  - Create a basic React application for the applicant portal with:
    - A form for A-9000 submission.
    - A status tracking page.
  - Implement a simple dashboard for internal users using USWDS components.

- **Backend Development:**
  - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for:
    - Handling form submissions.
    - Providing status updates.
  - Use Sequelize with PostgreSQL for basic data storage.

- **Platform Engineering:**
  - Set up a basic AWS environment with:
    - A simple CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
    - Infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for automated setup.

- **Stretch Goal:**
  - Implement a basic version of the automated scheduling assistant.
  - Add a simple real-time enrollment counter using WebSockets or a similar technology.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What specific data formats and irregularities should we anticipate in the immigration information?
2. Can we get more details on the "flashy" design requirements for the enrollment site?
3. Are there any specific customization options required for the workflow engine?
4. What are the expected surge capacity numbers beyond the 100K baseline?

### Deliverables

- Basic React application for applicant portal.
- Simple dashboard for internal users.
- Node.js backend with RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL database setup with Sequelize.
- AWS environment with CI/CD pipeline.
- Infrastructure as code scripts for automated setup.
- Documentation of the MVP and stretch goal implementation.
