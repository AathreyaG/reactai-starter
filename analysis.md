### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication of product data on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing product data through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: 
  - CSV files contain fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - APIs: RESTful APIs

- **Team Composition**:
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are already handled or not required for the MVP.
- The application will initially support only basic CSV upload and catalog management features.
- The publication process to GSA marketplaces is a simple file export for the MVP.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: No details on different user roles or permissions for catalog management.
- **Publication Process**: Unclear if there are specific requirements or integrations needed for publishing to GSA marketplaces.
- **Error Handling**: No details on how errors should be handled during CSV upload or catalog management.

### MVP Plan (5-6 Hours of Development Time)

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Validate and parse CSV files on the backend using Node.js and Sequelize.
   - Store parsed data in a Postgres database.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - Implement a search functionality to query the catalog using React and RESTful APIs.
   - Allow basic editing of catalog entries through a simple form interface.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publication to GSA Marketplaces**:
  - Implement a basic export functionality that formats the catalog data for publication.
  - Investigate initial integration points or requirements for FedMall or GSA Advantage.

### Deliverables

- CSV upload interface with validation.
- Backend service to parse and store CSV data.
- Basic catalog search and edit functionality.
- CSV download feature for the entire catalog.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. Are there specific file size limits for CSV uploads that we should consider?
2. What are the user roles and permissions, if any, for managing the catalog?
3. Are there specific requirements or formats needed for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
4. How should errors be handled and communicated to the user during CSV upload and catalog management?
