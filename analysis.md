### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Upload Functionality**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users need the ability to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data**:
  - The catalog data includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - A sample CSV data snippet is provided, indicating the format and type of data involved.

- **Technical Environment**:
  - The team consists of two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.
  - The tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and follows the sample provided.
- User authentication and authorization are already handled or are not required for the MVP.
- The application will initially support only the features explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.
- The application will be deployed on AWS, leveraging its services for hosting and database management.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size Limitations**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: It's unclear if different user roles will have different permissions for editing or publishing.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact mechanism for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Search Functionality**: The scope of search capabilities (e.g., full-text search, filtering) is not specified.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload Interface**:
   - Implement a frontend interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.

2. **Basic Search and Edit Functionality**:
   - Implement a simple search feature using Sequelize and Postgres to query the catalog.
   - Allow users to edit catalog entries directly from the interface.

3. **Download Catalog**:
   - Implement functionality to export the catalog data back into a CSV format for download.

4. **Basic Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Set up a basic AWS environment for hosting the application and database.

#### Stretch Goals

- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Implement more sophisticated search capabilities, such as filtering by specific fields.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Use USWDS components to improve the UI/UX.
- **Initial Publishing Mechanism**: Begin developing the process for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Basic search and edit functionality for the catalog.
- Ability to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage of the application.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. Are there specific file size limits for the CSV uploads that need to be considered?
2. What are the requirements for the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
3. Are there any specific user roles or permissions that need to be implemented for the MVP?
4. Is there a preference for how the search functionality should be implemented (e.g., specific fields to prioritize)?
