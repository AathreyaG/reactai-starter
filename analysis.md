### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication of product data on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Core Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Data Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Format**:
  - CSV files with fields: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, RESTful APIs, Sequelize
  - Database: Postgres
  - Platform: AWS

- **Team Composition**:
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

### Assumptions

- The CSV files are well-formed and adhere to the provided structure.
- Users have permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only English language and US currency.
- The MVP does not need to handle concurrent uploads or edits.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Authentication**: No details on how users will authenticate or manage permissions.
- **Publication Process**: The specifics of how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: No information on how errors (e.g., malformed CSVs) should be handled.
- **Search and Edit Functionality**: The depth of search and edit capabilities is not specified.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a frontend component using React and USWDS for CSV file upload.
   - Backend endpoint in Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in Postgres using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Data Management**:
   - Implement a simple search feature to query products by NSN or common name.
   - Allow basic editing of product details through a React interface.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the current catalog as a CSV.

4. **Basic UI**:
   - Develop a minimal UI using USWDS components for navigation and interaction.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Set up a basic AWS environment for hosting the application.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publication Feature**: Implement a basic mechanism to publish the catalog to a mock GSA marketplace endpoint.

### Deliverables

- CSV upload and parsing functionality.
- Basic search and edit capabilities for the product catalog.
- Download feature for the product catalog.
- Minimal UI for user interaction.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific file size limits for CSV uploads?
- How should user authentication and permissions be managed?
- What are the exact requirements for the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any specific error handling or logging requirements?
