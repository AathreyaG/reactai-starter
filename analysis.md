### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce that facilitates the upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog onto platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Core Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users need the ability to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export & Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Each product is identified by a National Stock Number (NSN).
  - Sample CSV fields include: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web-based interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Functionality to search and edit catalog entries.
  - Option to download or publish catalogs.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.
  - Team composition: 2 frontend engineers, 2 backend engineers, 1 platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and standardized as per the sample provided.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only the features explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.
- The application will be deployed on AWS infrastructure.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Authentication**: No details are provided on how users will be authenticated or authorized.
- **Publishing Mechanism**: The process and requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: No information on how errors (e.g., upload failures, CSV parsing errors) should be managed.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - **Frontend**: Create a simple UI using React and USWDS components for file upload.
   - **Backend**: Implement a Node.js endpoint to handle CSV file uploads and store data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - **Frontend**: Develop a basic search interface to query products by NSN or common name.
   - **Backend**: Implement search functionality using RESTful APIs to query the Postgres database.

3. **Download Catalog**:
   - **Frontend**: Provide a button to download the catalog as a CSV file.
   - **Backend**: Create an API endpoint to generate and return the CSV file from the database.

### Stretch Goal

- **Edit Product Catalog**: Allow users to edit product details directly from the UI and update the database accordingly.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Backend API for handling CSV uploads and storing data.
- Basic search functionality for the product catalog.
- Functionality to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Documentation on how to use the application and any setup instructions.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What are the specific requirements for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces?
2. Are there any specific user roles or permissions that need to be implemented?
3. What are the expected file size limits for CSV uploads?
4. How should error handling be managed, particularly for CSV parsing and upload failures?
