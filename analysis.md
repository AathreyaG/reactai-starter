### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Core Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publishing**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: 
  - Each product has a unique NSN and is associated with attributes like rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Upload CSV files.
  - Search and edit product details.
  - Download or publish catalogs.

- **Sample Data**: Provided CSV snippet with NSN, rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC fields.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent with the sample provided.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially be web-based, leveraging the tech stack provided.
- The MVP will focus on core functionalities without extensive error handling or user authentication.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: It's unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact steps and requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Data Validation**: The level of validation required for CSV data is not specified.

### MVP Plan

**Objective**: Develop a basic application with core functionalities within 5-6 hours.

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload Interface**:
   - Simple web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Basic validation for file format and structure.

2. **Catalog Search and Edit**:
   - Basic search functionality by NSN or common_name.
   - Simple edit interface for product details.

3. **Catalog Download**:
   - Ability to download the current catalog as a CSV file.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Publishing Functionality**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to publish the catalog to a mock GSA marketplace endpoint.

### Development Plan

1. **Frontend (React, USWDS Components)**:
   - Develop CSV upload and search/edit interfaces.
   - Implement basic styling and layout using USWDS components.

2. **Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)**:
   - Set up a database schema to store catalog data.
   - Implement RESTful APIs for uploading, searching, editing, and downloading catalogs.

3. **Platform (AWS)**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configuration.

### Deliverables

- CSV upload interface.
- Search and edit functionality for the catalog.
- Ability to download the catalog as a CSV.
- Basic deployment on AWS.
- Documentation on setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

1. What is the maximum file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
4. What level of data validation is required for the CSV files?
