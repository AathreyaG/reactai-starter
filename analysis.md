### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search for products in the catalog and edit their details.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**: A web-based interface is required for interaction with the application.

- **Tech Stack**: The team has expertise in React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will initially support basic CRUD operations for the catalog.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **File Size Limitations**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Roles**: The statement does not clarify if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publishing Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not provided.
- **Data Validation**: Requirements for data validation during upload are not specified.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.
   - Store uploaded data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Search and Edit Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic search feature using React to query the database.
   - Allow users to edit product details and update the database.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Provide an option to download the catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Basic UI**:
   - Use USWDS components to create a minimalistic and functional user interface.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineer's expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publish Functionality**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to simulate publishing the catalog to an external system.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for CSV file upload.
- Backend API for handling file uploads and CRUD operations.
- A Postgres database schema for storing catalog data.
- Basic search and edit functionality in the UI.
- CSV download feature.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improving MVP

1. What are the expected file size limits for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there any specific data validation rules for the CSV content?
