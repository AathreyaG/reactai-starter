### Problem Analysis

**Breadth of the Problem Statement:**

- **Applicant Portal:**
  - Develop a digital enrollment platform (A-9000) for applicants to submit their information.
  - The portal must handle at least 100K applicants per month, with a weekly average of 25K, plus additional surge capacity.
  - Real-time public enrollment counter and user portal for information collection.

- **Automated Scheduling:**
  - Intelligent scheduling across three ports of entry.
  - Assimilation of 50% of applicants per month across four sites, with each assimilation taking 45 minutes.

- **Customizable Workflow:**
  - Ability for AltantisGate Assimilators to modify process flows to optimize speed.
  - Low-code/no-code mobile proof of concept app for demonstration purposes. // No mobile app needed.

- **Performance Analysis:**
  - Analyze enrollment throughput to recommend surge capacity above the base 100K applicants.

**Depth of the Problem Statement:**

- **Technical Requirements:**
  - Use AWS FedRAMP services, open-source/free software, and environment access.
  - Implement a continuous delivery pipeline for infrastructure and architecture.
  - Automated scripts for infrastructure setup and deployment.
  - Automated security scans and code testing in the pipeline.

- **User Stories:**
  - Applicants need to submit information, schedule enrollment, track status, and receive notifications.
  - Internal users need dashboards for processing times, queues, and scheduling adjustments.
  - Supervisors need to approve enrollments for scheduling.
  - DevSecOps engineers need to create and manage AWS environments, pipelines, and workflows.

**Assumptions:**

- The platform will initially focus on core functionalities, with advanced features as stretch goals.
- The surge capacity is unknown, but a reasonable estimate will be made based on historical data analysis.
- The mobile proof of concept app is not required to be fully functional, just demonstrable.

**Uncertainties and Ambiguities:**

- The exact nature and format of historical immigration data for surge analysis.
- Specific customization requirements for the workflow engine.
- Details on the low-code/no-code platform capabilities and integration.

### MVP Plan (5-6 Hours of Development Time)

**Core MVP Features:**

1. **Applicant Portal:**
   - Basic form for A-9000 submission using React and Node.js.
   - Real-time enrollment counter using WebSockets or similar technology.

2. **Automated Scheduling:**
   - Simple scheduling logic for distributing applicants across ports of entry.

3. **Customizable Workflow:**
   - Basic workflow engine setup using a low-code platform for demonstration.

4. **Infrastructure Setup:**
   - Basic AWS environment setup using automated scripts for deployment.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - Simple dashboard for internal users to view processing times and queues.

**Stretch Goal:**

- Implement a more advanced scheduling algorithm considering surge capacity.
- Enhance the dashboard with more detailed analytics and reporting.

### Deliverables

- Functional applicant portal with real-time counter.
- Basic scheduling logic for port distribution.
- Initial setup of a customizable workflow engine.
- AWS environment setup with automated deployment scripts.
- Simple internal dashboard for monitoring and adjustments.
- Documentation of the development process and instructions for deployment.
