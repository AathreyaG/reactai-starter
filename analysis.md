### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Features Required**:
  - **Upload Functionality**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users must have the ability to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
  
- **Data Format**: CSV files with fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Current System**: Over 2.5 million items are available, indicating a need for efficient data handling and processing.

### Assumptions

- The CSV upload will handle varying file sizes, but specifics on size limits are not provided.
- The application will be web-based, accessible via standard web browsers.
- User authentication and authorization are not mentioned but may be necessary for secure access.
- The sample CSV format provided is representative of the data structure expected.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **File Size Limits**: The maximum size of CSV files that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **User Roles**: The problem statement does not specify if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publication Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not provided.
- **Data Validation**: The level of data validation required during upload is unclear.

### MVP Plan

**Objective**: Develop a basic application that allows CSV uploads, basic search, and download functionality.

#### Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a simple web interface using React for CSV file upload.
   - Implement a basic search functionality for the catalog.
   - Develop a download button to export the catalog.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling CSV uploads and search queries.
   - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database for storing catalog data.
   - Implement basic data validation and error handling during CSV upload.

3. **Platform Engineering**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS, ensuring it is accessible and scalable.
   - Set up a Postgres database on AWS for storing catalog data.

#### Stretch Goal

- Implement basic editing functionality for catalog entries.
- Add a simple user authentication mechanism to secure access.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Basic search functionality for the catalog.
- Download functionality for the entire catalog.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation of the application setup and usage.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What are the specific file size limits for CSV uploads?
2. Are there different user roles with specific permissions?
3. What is the expected process for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces?
4. What level of data validation is required during CSV uploads?
