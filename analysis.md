### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users can upload CSV files through a web interface.
  - **Data Management**: Users can search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Sample CSV fields include NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  - The data involves product details like name, description, price, and identifiers.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Ability to search and edit the catalog.
  - Options to download or publish the catalog.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - Database: Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - Language: TypeScript

### Assumptions

- The CSV upload feature should handle varying file sizes efficiently.
- Users have permissions to edit and publish catalogs.
- The application will integrate with existing GSA platforms for publishing.
- The scope is limited to the features mentioned; no additional features like user authentication are considered.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **User Roles**: It is unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact process for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: There is no mention of how errors during upload or publishing should be handled.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic web interface using React for CSV file uploads.
   - Backend API in Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in Postgres using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Data Display**:
   - Create a simple React component to display the uploaded data in a tabular format.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic search feature to filter products based on NSN or common name.

4. **Edit Functionality**:
   - Allow users to edit product details directly in the table and update the database.

5. **Download Feature**:
   - Enable users to download the current catalog as a CSV file.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publish Functionality**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to publish the catalog to a mock GSA marketplace endpoint.

### Deliverables

- A basic web interface for CSV upload and data display.
- Backend API for handling CSV uploads and data storage.
- Search and edit functionality for the product catalog.
- CSV download feature for the catalog.
- Documentation on how to set up and run the application.
- Stretch goal: Basic publish functionality to a mock endpoint.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected size of the CSV files?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
4. What are the error handling requirements for upload and publishing processes?
