### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes via a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV files contain fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Current Catalog**: Over 2.5 million items available, indicating the need for efficient handling of large datasets.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and follows the sample structure provided.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will primarily serve federal buyers and GSA personnel.
- The application should be secure and comply with federal data handling regulations.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **File Size Limits**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: The problem statement does not detail user roles or access levels.
- **Integration with GSA Marketplaces**: The specifics of how the catalog is published to platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage are not detailed.
- **Performance Requirements**: No specific performance benchmarks or SLAs are mentioned.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a basic web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.
   - Store uploaded files temporarily in AWS S3.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - Parse CSV files and store data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.
   - Implement a simple search functionality using React and Node.js.
   - Allow basic editing of catalog entries through the web interface.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the catalog as a CSV file from the database.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineer's expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publish to GSA Marketplaces**:
  - Implement a basic RESTful API to simulate publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces.
  - This could involve sending a JSON representation of the catalog to a mock endpoint.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV upload.
- Backend service for handling uploads and parsing CSV files.
- Database schema for storing catalog data.
- Search and edit functionality for catalog entries.
- CSV download feature.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific file size limits for uploads?
- Can we get more details on the required integration with GSA marketplaces?
- Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
- Are there any specific security or compliance requirements we need to be aware of?
