### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Data Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Sample CSV fields include NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  - Each product has a unique NSN.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading and managing CSV files.
  - Ability to search and edit product information.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components.
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres.
  - Platform: AWS.
  - APIs: RESTful.

### Assumptions

- Users have valid credentials to access the application.
- CSV files are well-formed and follow a predefined schema.
- The application will handle only text-based data (no images or multimedia).
- The publication process involves exporting data in a compatible format for GSA marketplaces.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV Schema**: Detailed schema requirements for CSV files are not specified.
- **User Roles**: No information on user roles or permissions.
- **Publication Process**: Specifics on how the publication to GSA marketplaces is handled.
- **Data Volume**: Handling of large CSV files and performance considerations.

### MVP Plan

**Objective**: Develop a minimal viable product that allows CSV upload, basic search, and edit functionality.

#### Tasks

1. **Frontend Development** (React, USWDS components)
   - Create a simple UI for CSV upload.
   - Implement a basic search and edit interface for product data.

2. **Backend Development** (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)
   - Set up a database schema to store product data.
   - Develop RESTful APIs for:
     - CSV upload and parsing.
     - Product search and edit functionalities.

3. **Platform Setup** (AWS)
   - Deploy the application on AWS.
   - Ensure basic security and access controls.

#### Timeline

- **Design and Architecture Discussion**: 1 hour
- **Frontend Development**: 2 hours
- **Backend Development**: 2 hours
- **Integration and Testing**: 1 hour
- **Deployment**: 1 hour

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the download functionality to export the catalog in a format compatible with GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for CSV upload and basic product management.
- RESTful APIs for handling product data.
- Deployed application on AWS with basic security configurations.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improvement

1. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
2. What are the detailed requirements for the CSV schema?
3. How is the publication process to GSA marketplaces expected to work?
4. Are there any specific performance requirements for handling large CSV files?
