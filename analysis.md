### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- **Core Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users can search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export/Publish**: Users can download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- **Data Structure**: The CSV contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
- **User Interaction**: The application should be user-friendly, allowing seamless navigation and operations.

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language and US currency.
- The application will handle only text-based data without images or multimedia.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **User Roles**: It's unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Error Handling**: The specifics of error handling during upload, search, edit, and publish operations are not detailed.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact method or API for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not provided.
- **Data Security**: Details on data encryption and security measures are not mentioned.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a web interface for CSV file upload.
   - Validate CSV structure and data types upon upload.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - Implement a search feature to query products by NSN or common name.
   - Allow basic editing of product details.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the catalog as a CSV file.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Publish Functionality**: Implement a basic integration with a mock API to simulate publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Development Plan

- **Frontend Engineers**:
  - Develop the web interface using React and USWDS components.
  - Implement the CSV upload and search UI.

- **Backend Engineers**:
  - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling CSV uploads, search, and edit operations.
  - Use Sequelize and Postgres for database interactions.

- **Platform Engineer**:
  - Set up AWS infrastructure for deployment.
  - Ensure scalability and reliability of the application.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for CSV upload and catalog management.
- Backend APIs for handling CSV data and catalog operations.
- A Postgres database schema to store catalog data.
- Basic user interface for searching and editing catalog entries.
- Documentation on how to use the application.
- Deployment of the MVP on AWS.

### Questions for Improving MVP

1. What is the maximum file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions we need to consider?
3. Can we get access to the API documentation for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards we need to adhere to?
