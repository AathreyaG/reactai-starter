### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication of product data on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Data Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Each product is identified by a National Stock Number (NSN).
  - Sample CSV fields include NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Search and edit functionality for product catalogs.
  - Option to download or publish the catalog.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components.
  - Backend: Node.js, Express, Sequelize.
  - Database: PostgreSQL.
  - Platform: AWS for hosting and deployment.
  - APIs: RESTful for communication between frontend and backend.

### Assumptions

- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will handle basic CSV file sizes initially, with scalability considered later.
- The application will be deployed on AWS, leveraging its services for scalability and reliability.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Details on user roles and permissions for accessing different features are not provided.
- **Publication Process**: The exact process for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not detailed.
- **Error Handling**: Specifics on error handling and validation for CSV uploads are not mentioned.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Backend API endpoint in Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in PostgreSQL.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Implement a simple search functionality using React and Node.js to query the PostgreSQL database.
   - Basic editing capability for product details.

3. **Publication**:
   - Provide a download option for the catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using basic EC2 instances or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Add advanced search and filtering options.
- Integrate with GSA marketplaces for direct publication.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV upload.
- Backend API for handling CSV data and storing it in PostgreSQL.
- Basic search and edit functionality.
- Download option for the catalog.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

1. What is the maximum file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
4. What are the expected error handling and validation requirements for CSV uploads?
