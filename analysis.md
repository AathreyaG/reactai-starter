### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **File Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface. The application must handle varying file sizes.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**: The CSV file includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: React, USWDS components
  - **Backend**: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - **Database**: Postgres
  - **Platform**: AWS

### Assumptions

- The application will primarily be web-based.
- User authentication and authorization are not explicitly mentioned but may be necessary for secure access.
- The CSV file format is standardized and will not change frequently.
- The application will be deployed on AWS, utilizing its services for hosting and storage.
- Publishing to GSA marketplaces involves a straightforward API call or file transfer.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **User Authentication**: The problem statement does not mention user roles or authentication requirements.
- **CSV File Size Limits**: The exact limits for file size are not specified.
- **Publishing Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not provided.
- **Error Handling**: The problem statement does not specify how errors should be managed during file upload or processing.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **Frontend (React + USWDS)**:
   - Implement a basic UI for file upload.
   - Display a simple table for viewing uploaded CSV data.
   - Allow basic search functionality within the table.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Sequelize + Postgres)**:
   - Set up a basic API endpoint for file upload.
   - Parse CSV data and store it in a Postgres database.
   - Implement a simple search API for querying the catalog.

3. **Platform (AWS)**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using a basic EC2 instance or AWS Lambda for the backend.
   - Use AWS S3 for temporary storage of uploaded CSV files.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement basic edit functionality for catalog entries.
- Add a download feature to export the catalog as a CSV file.
- Begin integration with GSA marketplaces for publishing, if time permits.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- A backend service to process and store CSV data.
- A basic search functionality for the catalog.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation on how to use the application and any setup required.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any user roles or permissions that need to be considered?
- Is there a need for data validation or error reporting during CSV upload?
- What are the expected file size limits for uploads?
