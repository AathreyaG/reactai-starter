**Detailed Analysis of the Problem Statement:**

- **Objective:** Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication of the catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features:**
  - **CSV Upload:** Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface. The application must handle varying file sizes.
  - **Catalog Management:** Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export Functionality:** Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure:** The catalog data includes fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction:** The application should provide a seamless user experience for uploading, searching, editing, and exporting catalog data.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - Database: Postgres
  - Platform: AWS

- **Team Composition:**
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

**Assumptions:**

- Users have basic technical knowledge to interact with web applications.
- The CSV format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- Security and authentication are not the primary focus for the MVP but will be considered for future development.

**Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity:**

- Specific requirements for CSV file validation (e.g., maximum file size, mandatory fields).
- Detailed user roles and permissions for catalog management.
- Specific platforms for publication (e.g., FedMall, GSA Advantage) and their integration requirements.
- Handling of concurrent uploads or edits by multiple users.

**MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time):**

1. **Frontend:**
   - Develop a simple web interface using React and USWDS components for CSV upload.
   - Implement a basic search functionality for catalog items.
   - Display catalog items in a tabular format.

2. **Backend:**
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful API endpoints for CSV upload and catalog retrieval.
   - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database to store catalog data.
   - Implement basic error handling and validation for CSV uploads.

3. **Platform:**
   - Deploy the application on AWS using a simple architecture (e.g., EC2 for hosting, S3 for file storage).
   - Ensure basic scalability and reliability.

**Stretch Goal:**

- Implement editing functionality for catalog items.
- Add export functionality to download the catalog as a CSV file.

**Deliverables:**

- A web interface for CSV upload and catalog search.
- Backend API endpoints for CSV processing and data retrieval.
- A deployed application on AWS with basic functionality.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
- A list of identified improvements and next steps for future development.
