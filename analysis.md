### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download/Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  
- **User Interaction**:
  - Users will interact with a web interface for uploading and managing the catalog.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: React, USWDS components
  - **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Postgres
  - **Platform**: AWS for deployment and hosting
  - **APIs**: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will initially support only CSV files for upload.
- The scope is limited to the features mentioned in the problem statement.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- Specific requirements for the search and edit functionalities (e.g., search filters, edit permissions).
- Details on how the catalog should be published to GSA marketplaces.
- Handling of large CSV files and performance considerations.
- Error handling and validation specifics for CSV uploads.

### MVP Plan

1. **Frontend**:
   - Implement a basic React application using USWDS components.
   - Create a file upload interface for CSV files.
   - Display a simple table to show uploaded CSV data.

2. **Backend**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with Express.
   - Implement an API endpoint for CSV file upload and parsing.
   - Store parsed data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

3. **Platform**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS (e.g., using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2).

4. **Basic Search**:
   - Implement a simple search functionality on the frontend to filter displayed data.

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Ensure basic validation for CSV uploads (e.g., file type, required fields).

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the ability to edit catalog entries directly from the web interface.
- Add functionality to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Begin initial work on the publish feature to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV upload and display.
- A Node.js backend with an API for handling CSV uploads.
- A Postgres database schema to store catalog data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Basic search functionality on the frontend.
- Documentation on how to use the application and any setup instructions.
