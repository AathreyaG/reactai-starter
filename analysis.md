### Detailed Analysis of the Problem Statement

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface. These files can vary in size.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interaction**:
  - The application should provide a seamless user experience for uploading, searching, editing, downloading, and publishing catalogs.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - Database: Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - Language: TypeScript

### Assumptions

- The application will be web-based and accessible via standard web browsers.
- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before processing.
- The application will handle basic CRUD operations for catalog management.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP scope.
- Publishing to GSA marketplaces involves exporting the catalog in a specific format, which is predefined.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: There is no specific mention of the maximum file size that can be handled.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact process and format required to publish to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: It's unclear if different user roles will have different permissions.
- **Error Handling**: The problem statement does not specify how errors should be handled during CSV upload or catalog management.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours)

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic web interface using React for uploading CSV files.
   - Backend API in Node.js to handle file upload and parse CSV using a library like `csv-parser`.
   - Store parsed data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Catalog Search and Edit**:
   - Simple search functionality on the frontend to query the database.
   - Basic edit functionality to update catalog entries.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Implement a feature to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publish Functionality**:
  - Implement the ability to export the catalog in the required format for GSA marketplaces.
  - Create a basic UI for initiating the publish process.

### Deliverables

- Basic web interface for CSV upload, search, edit, and download.
- Backend API for handling CSV uploads and database operations.
- Postgres database schema for storing catalog data.
- Documentation for setting up and running the application.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected size of the CSV files?
2. Are there specific validation rules for the CSV data?
3. What format is required for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there any specific security requirements for the application?
5. Will there be different user roles with varying permissions?
