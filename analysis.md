### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should have the capability to search for specific products and edit their details.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file includes fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**:
  - A web interface is required for file uploads and interaction with the catalog.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS
  - APIs: RESTful

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **File Size Limitations**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **Data Validation**: The extent of data validation required for CSV uploads.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact mechanism for publishing to GSA marketplaces is unclear.
- **User Roles**: Different user roles and permissions are not defined.

### MVP Plan

**Objective**: Develop a basic application that allows CSV upload, search, and basic editing of the catalog.

#### Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a simple React interface for CSV file upload.
   - Implement a basic search functionality.
   - Develop a form for editing product details.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling CSV uploads and product data operations.
   - Implement Sequelize models for the product catalog.
   - Develop endpoints for search and update operations.

3. **Platform Setup**:
   - Configure a basic AWS environment for deployment.
   - Set up a Postgres database on AWS.

#### Stretch Goal

- Implement the download functionality for the catalog.
- Begin integration for publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- A React-based web interface for CSV uploads, search, and edit functionalities.
- Node.js RESTful API for handling backend operations.
- Postgres database schema and initial setup.
- AWS deployment scripts and basic configuration.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for data validation during CSV upload?
- Are there any specific security requirements for the application?
- Can we get more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
- What are the expected user roles and permissions for the application?
