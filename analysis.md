### Detailed Explanation of the Problem

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Curation**: Users can search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- **Data**: The catalog consists of items identified by National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and includes details like representative office, common name, description, price, unit of issue (UI), and acquisition advice code (AAC).
- **Sample Data**: Provided in CSV format with fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC.

### Analysis of the Problem Statement

- **Breadth**:
  - The application should support file uploads of varying sizes.
  - It should provide a user-friendly interface for searching and editing catalog entries.
  - The application should facilitate the publication of the catalog to external platforms.

- **Depth**:
  - **CSV Parsing**: The application must correctly parse CSV files to extract and store product data.
  - **Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of catalog data for search and edit operations.
  - **Integration**: Ability to publish the catalog to external platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

### Assumptions

- The CSV files are well-formed and follow a consistent schema.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially focus on basic CRUD operations for the catalog.
- The publication process involves generating a downloadable file or API call to external platforms.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- Specific requirements for the publication process to external platforms.
- Handling of large CSV files and potential performance implications.
- User authentication and authorization details.
- Error handling and validation for CSV uploads.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload**:
   - Implement a simple web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Parse and store CSV data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Search and Edit**:
   - Implement a search functionality to find products by NSN or common name.
   - Allow users to edit product details and save changes to the database.

3. **Download Catalog**:
   - Provide an option to download the entire catalog as a CSV file.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Publication to External Platforms**:
  - Implement a basic API integration or file export functionality to publish the catalog to FedMall or GSA Advantage.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV file upload.
- Backend service to parse and store CSV data.
- Search and edit functionality for the product catalog.
- Option to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
