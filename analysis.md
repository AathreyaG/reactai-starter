### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should have the ability to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- **Data**: Each product is identified by a unique National Stock Number (NSN) and includes fields like rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC.
- **Tech Stack**: React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are handled outside the scope of this MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- The application will be deployed on AWS infrastructure.
- The MVP will focus on basic CRUD operations without complex business logic or integrations.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **Search Functionality**: The extent and complexity of search features are not detailed.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact process for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not defined.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Details on different user roles and permissions are not provided.
- **Error Handling**: Specific error handling and validation requirements are not mentioned.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for uploading CSV files.
   - Backend endpoint in Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in Postgres using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Search and Edit Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic search feature using React to query the Postgres database.
   - Allow editing of product details with a simple form interface.

3. **Download Feature**:
   - Provide an option to download the current catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineer's expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement a basic publish feature that simulates publishing to a marketplace.
- Enhance search functionality with filters and sorting options.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Backend API endpoints for handling CSV uploads and CRUD operations.
- Basic search and edit functionality for product catalogs.
- CSV download feature for the entire catalog.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What is the maximum expected file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there specific search filters or criteria that need to be implemented?
3. Can you provide more details on the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there specific user roles and permissions that need to be considered in the MVP?
5. What are the expectations for error handling and validation in the application?
