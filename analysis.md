### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search for and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV file contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: React, USWDS components
  - **Backend**: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize
  - **Database**: Postgres
  - **Cloud**: AWS
  - **Language**: TypeScript

- **Team Composition**:
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are already handled or are out of scope for this MVP.
- The application will initially be deployed on AWS.
- The MVP will focus on the core functionality of uploading, searching, editing, and downloading catalogs.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The problem statement mentions varying file sizes but does not specify limits.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Unclear if different user roles have different access levels.
- **Publishing Process**: Details on how the catalog is published to GSA marketplaces are not specified.

### MVP Plan

- **Frontend**:
  - Implement a simple UI using React and USWDS components for CSV upload.
  - Create a basic search and edit interface for the catalog.
  - Provide a download button for the catalog.

- **Backend**:
  - Set up a Node.js server with RESTful APIs for handling CSV uploads, catalog search, edit, and download functionalities.
  - Use Sequelize to interact with a Postgres database to store catalog data.

- **Platform**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS, ensuring basic scalability and security.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement the publishing functionality to GSA marketplaces.
- Add more advanced search and filtering options for the catalog.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Basic search and edit functionality for the product catalog.
- Ability to download the catalog.
- Deployment of the MVP on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for the publishing process to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any specific CSV file size limits or performance requirements?
- Is there a need for user authentication and role-based access control in the MVP?
