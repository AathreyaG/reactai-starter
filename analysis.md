### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce that allows seamless upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files through a web interface. The files can vary in size.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.
  
- **Data Structure**: 
  - The CSV file contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  
- **User Interaction**:
  - Web-based interface for uploading, searching, editing, downloading, and publishing catalogs.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is consistent and validated before upload.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- The application will be hosted on AWS, leveraging its services for deployment and scalability.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size that can be uploaded is not specified.
- **User Authentication**: The problem statement does not specify how user authentication and authorization will be handled.
- **Publishing Process**: The exact process and requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces are not detailed.
- **Search and Edit Functionality**: The depth and complexity of search and edit features are not specified.

### MVP Plan (5-6 hours of development time)

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a basic web interface using React for CSV file upload.
   - Backend API using Node.js to handle file uploads and store data in Postgres.

2. **Catalog Search**:
   - Implement a simple search feature on the frontend to query the catalog.
   - Backend API to support search queries.

3. **Basic Catalog Display**:
   - Display uploaded catalog data in a tabular format using React.

4. **Download Feature**:
   - Implement a feature to download the catalog as a CSV file.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS with basic configurations.

### Stretch Goal

- **Edit Functionality**: Allow users to edit catalog entries directly in the web interface.
- **Publish Functionality**: Implement a basic mechanism to simulate publishing to GSA marketplaces.

### Deliverables

- Basic web interface for CSV upload and catalog display.
- Backend APIs for handling file uploads, search, and download.
- Simple search functionality for catalog data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation of the application setup and usage.

### Questions for Improving the MVP

1. What are the specific requirements for publishing to GSA marketplaces?
2. Is there a preferred authentication method for user access control?
3. Are there any specific performance requirements for handling large CSV files?
4. Should the application support multiple languages or just English initially?
