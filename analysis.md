### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
- **Functionality Requirements**:
  - Upload CSV files via a web interface.
  - Handle varying file sizes.
  - Search and edit product catalogs.
  - Download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
- **Data Structure**:
  - CSV file with columns: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  - Sample data provided for reference.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Users should be able to upload CSV files.
  - Users should be able to search and edit the catalog.
  - Users should be able to download or publish the catalog.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file structure is consistent and does not change.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will primarily serve federal buyers and GSA personnel.
- The application will be web-based and accessible through standard web browsers.
- The MVP will focus on core functionalities, with advanced features as stretch goals.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- Specifics on user authentication and authorization are not provided.
- Details on how the catalog should be published to GSA marketplaces are unclear.
- The extent of editing capabilities (e.g., which fields can be edited) is not specified.
- The performance requirements for handling large CSV files are not mentioned.
- No information on error handling or data validation processes.

### MVP Plan

- **Frontend (React, USWDS components)**:
  - Implement a simple web interface for CSV file upload.
  - Create a basic search functionality for the catalog.
  - Display the uploaded catalog in a tabular format.
  
- **Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)**:
  - Set up a RESTful API to handle CSV uploads and data storage.
  - Implement basic search and retrieval functionality for the catalog.
  - Store uploaded CSV data in a Postgres database.

- **Platform (AWS)**:
  - Deploy the application on AWS.
  - Ensure basic security and access controls are in place.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement basic editing functionality for catalog entries.
- Add download functionality for the catalog.
- Begin exploring integration with GSA marketplaces for publishing.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- A basic search functionality for the catalog.
- A RESTful API for handling CSV data.
- A Postgres database to store catalog data.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific requirements for publishing the catalog to GSA marketplaces?
- Are there any specific security or compliance requirements we need to consider?
- Can we assume that the CSV files will always be well-formed, or do we need to implement validation?
- What are the expected load and performance requirements for the application?
