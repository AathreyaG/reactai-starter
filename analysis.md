### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the upload, curation, and publication of the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Export/Publish**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Current Data**: The catalog includes over 2.5 million items, each with a unique NSN and associated details like rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC.

- **Sample CSV Data**: Provided format includes columns for NSN, rep_office, common_name, description, price, UI, and AAC.

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is standardized and will not change frequently. Let's restrict the file size to 100MB.
- Users have the necessary permissions to upload, edit, and publish catalogs.
- The application will be web-based and accessible to users with appropriate credentials.
- The application will integrate with existing GSA platforms like FedMall and GSA Advantage.
- The application will handle large datasets efficiently.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **User Authentication**: Details on user authentication and authorization are not provided. Single person app, no auth.
- **Integration Details**: Specifics on how the application will integrate with FedMall and GSA Advantage are not clear.
- **Data Validation**: The level of data validation required for CSV uploads is not specified.
- **Error Handling**: How errors in CSV uploads or during publication should be handled is not detailed.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Feature**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for users to upload CSV files.
   - Use Node.js and Express to handle file uploads on the backend.
   - Store uploaded files temporarily on AWS S3.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - Parse CSV files and display data in a tabular format using React.
   - Allow basic search functionality on the displayed data.

3. **Export/Download Functionality**:
   - Implement a feature to download the catalog data as a CSV file.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineer's expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement basic edit functionality for the catalog data.
- Set up a simple authentication mechanism using AWS Cognito.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading CSV files.
- Backend service to handle file uploads and parsing.
- Basic search functionality for catalog data.
- CSV download feature.
- Deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for the MVP implementation.

### Questions for Improvement

- What are the specific integration requirements with FedMall and GSA Advantage?
- Are there specific data validation rules for the CSV uploads?
- What is the expected user load, and how should we handle concurrent uploads?
- Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards to follow?
