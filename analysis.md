### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to manage the Global Supply catalog, enabling upload, curation, and publication of product data on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files of varying sizes through a web interface.
  - **Data Management**: Users can search, edit, and manage product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users can download or publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - Sample CSV includes fields: NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, AAC.
  
- **User Interaction**:
  - Web interface for uploading CSV files.
  - Interface for searching and editing product catalogs.
  - Option to download or publish catalogs.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.
  - Team composition: 2 frontend engineers, 2 backend engineers, 1 platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- The application will initially support basic CRUD operations for the catalog.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The publication process to GSA marketplaces is a simple export function.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: No specific limits are mentioned for file sizes.
- **Publication Process**: Details on how the publication to GSA marketplaces should be handled are vague.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: No information on different user roles or access levels.
- **Error Handling**: Unclear how errors in CSV uploads or data processing should be managed.

### MVP Plan

#### Frontend (React)

- **CSV Upload Interface**: 
  - Simple form to upload CSV files.
  - Display upload status and basic validation feedback.
  
- **Catalog Management Interface**:
  - Basic table view to display catalog data.
  - Search functionality for catalog items.
  - Edit functionality for individual catalog entries.

#### Backend (Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres)

- **CSV Processing**:
  - Endpoint to handle CSV file uploads.
  - Parse CSV data and store it in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

- **Catalog Management API**:
  - CRUD endpoints for catalog data.
  - Search functionality for catalog items.

#### Platform (AWS)

- **Deployment**:
  - Set up a basic AWS infrastructure for hosting the application.
  - Ensure database connectivity and secure data storage.

### Stretch Goal

- **Publication Feature**:
  - Implement a basic export functionality to download the catalog as a CSV file.
  - Begin integration with GSA marketplaces for direct publication.

### Deliverables

- CSV upload interface with basic validation.
- Catalog management interface with search and edit capabilities.
- Backend API for CSV processing and catalog management.
- Basic AWS deployment setup.
- Documentation for setup and usage instructions.

### Questions for Improvement

1. What are the specific requirements for the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
2. Are there any specific user roles or permissions that need to be implemented?
3. What are the expected error handling and logging requirements for CSV uploads and data processing?
4. Is there a need for user authentication in the MVP, or can it be deferred to a later phase?
