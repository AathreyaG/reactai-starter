### Problem Statement Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce (AWF) to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users should be able to upload CSV files containing product data.
  - **Search and Edit**: Users should be able to search through the catalog and edit product details.
  - **Download and Publish**: Users should be able to download the catalog or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

- **Data Structure**:
  - The CSV file contains fields like NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.
  - Example data provided shows a typical structure and content of the CSV file.

- **User Interface**:
  - A web interface is required for uploading CSV files and interacting with the catalog.

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - The tech stack includes React, Node.js, AWS, TypeScript, USWDS components, RESTful APIs, Sequelize, and Postgres.

- **Team Composition**:
  - Two frontend engineers, two backend engineers, and one platform engineer.

### Assumptions

- The CSV file format is consistent and validated before upload.
- User authentication and authorization are already handled or not required for the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language and US currency.
- The MVP does not require integration with FedMall or GSA Advantage, only the capability to prepare data for such platforms.

### Areas of Uncertainty or Ambiguity

- Specific requirements for the search functionality (e.g., full-text search, filters).
- Details on how the publication to GSA marketplaces should be handled.
- The extent of editing capabilities (e.g., which fields are editable).
- Performance requirements for handling large CSV files.
- Error handling and validation requirements for CSV uploads.

### MVP Plan

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Implement a simple web interface using React for uploading CSV files.
   - Backend API using Node.js and Express to handle file uploads and parse CSV data.
   - Store parsed data in a Postgres database using Sequelize.

2. **Basic Search and Display**:
   - Implement a basic search functionality on the frontend using React.
   - Backend API to support search queries and return results from the database.

3. **Data Display and Edit**:
   - Display the catalog data in a tabular format using USWDS components.
   - Allow inline editing of certain fields (e.g., common_name, Description, Price).

4. **Download Functionality**:
   - Implement a feature to download the catalog as a CSV file.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on AWS using the platform engineerâ€™s expertise.

### Stretch Goal

- Implement a basic publish feature that prepares the catalog data in a format suitable for GSA marketplaces, without actual integration.

### Deliverables

- A web interface for uploading and managing the product catalog.
- Backend APIs for handling CSV uploads, searches, and data retrieval.
- A database schema for storing catalog data.
- Basic search and edit capabilities for the catalog.
- CSV download functionality.
- Deployment of the application on AWS.
- Documentation of the code and deployment process.
