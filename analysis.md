### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Develop an application for the GSA Acquisition Workforce to upload, curate, and publish the Global Supply catalog on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.
  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **CSV Upload**: Users must be able to upload CSV files containing product information through a web interface.
  - **Catalog Management**: Users should be able to search and edit product catalogs.
  - **Publication**: Users should be able to download or publish the entire catalog to GSA marketplaces.
  
- **Data**:
  - Each product is identified by a National Stock Number (NSN).
  - The CSV contains fields such as NSN, rep_office, common_name, Description, Price, UI, and AAC.

- **User Interface**:
  - A web interface is required for file uploads and catalog management.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React, USWDS components
  - Backend: Node.js, Restful APIs, Sequelize, Postgres
  - Platform: AWS

- **Team Composition**:
  - 2 Frontend Engineers
  - 2 Backend Engineers
  - 1 Platform Engineer

### Assumptions

- The CSV format is standardized and consistent with the sample provided.
- User authentication and authorization are not part of the MVP.
- The application will initially support only English language.
- The application will be deployed on AWS.
- The MVP will focus on basic functionality without advanced features like version control or detailed analytics.

### Areas of Uncertainty

- **CSV File Size**: The maximum file size for uploads is not specified.
- **Search Functionality**: The extent and complexity of search capabilities are not detailed.
- **Publication Process**: The exact method for publishing to GSA marketplaces is not described.
- **User Roles**: It is unclear if there are different user roles with varying permissions.
- **Error Handling**: Specifics on error handling and user feedback are not provided.

### MVP Plan

#### Core Features for MVP

1. **CSV Upload Functionality**:
   - Develop a web interface for uploading CSV files.
   - Implement backend logic to parse and store CSV data in a Postgres database.

2. **Basic Catalog Management**:
   - Implement a simple search functionality based on NSN or common_name.
   - Allow users to edit product details directly from the web interface.

3. **Download Functionality**:
   - Enable users to download the catalog as a CSV file.

4. **Basic UI Design**:
   - Use USWDS components to create a simple and consistent user interface.

#### Stretch Goal

- **Publication to GSA Marketplaces**:
  - Implement a basic mechanism to publish the catalog to external platforms like GSA Advantage.

### Deliverables

- Web interface for CSV file upload.
- Backend service to parse and store CSV data.
- Basic search and edit functionality for the product catalog.
- CSV download capability.
- Initial deployment on AWS.
- Documentation for setup and usage.

### Questions for Improving MVP

1. What is the maximum file size for CSV uploads?
2. Are there any specific search filters or criteria required beyond NSN and common_name?
3. Can you provide more details on the publication process to GSA marketplaces?
4. Are there different user roles with specific permissions?
5. What are the expected error handling and user feedback mechanisms?
