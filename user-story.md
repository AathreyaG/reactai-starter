### **Title: Upload CSV File** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search and Edit Catalog Entries** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog entries to ensure data accuracy and relevance.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for specific catalog entries and edit them as needed. The backend should support query and update operations on the catalog database. The UI should provide a user-friendly interface for searching and editing entries.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I search for a specific NSN and click on an entry
THEN the system should display the entry details and allow me to edit and save changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must allow searches by NSN and other relevant fields.
- Users should be able to edit fields such as common_name, Description, and Price.
- Changes must be saved in PostgreSQL and reflected in the UI.
- The system should offer confirmation upon successful edits.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search API to query catalog entries.
- Develop update API to handle edit requests.
- Ensure data integrity and validation in PostgreSQL.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search bar and results table using React.
- Build an editable form for catalog entry details.
- Implement state management for search and edit operations.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Develop search functionality and results display.
- Frontend: Create form for editing catalog entries.
- Backend: Implement search API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement update API endpoint.
- Backend: Ensure data validation and integrity checks.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid and invalid queries.
- Test editing functionality with valid and invalid data.
- Verify data persistence and accuracy in the database.
- Perform usability testing for the search and edit interface.

### **Title: Export Catalog Data** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to export catalog data so that I can publish it on GSA marketplaces.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to export catalog data into a CSV format compatible with GSA marketplaces. The backend should handle data retrieval and CSV generation. The UI should provide an option to download the generated file.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click the "Export" button
THEN the system should generate a CSV file and prompt me to download it

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must generate a CSV file containing all catalog entries.
- The CSV format must be compatible with GSA marketplaces.
- Users should be notified of successful export and download.
- Generated files should be logged in AWS CloudWatch for auditing.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement CSV generation logic in Node.js.
- Develop API endpoint to initiate CSV export.
- Log export activities in AWS CloudWatch.

Frontend Implications:

- Add an "Export" button to the catalog management UI.
- Implement feedback for export status and download prompt.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement "Export" button and feedback mechanism.
- Backend: Create CSV generation logic and endpoint.
- Backend: Log export status and activities.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV generation with complete and partial data sets.
- Verify CSV format compatibility with GSA requirements.
- Test download functionality and user feedback.
- Perform log verification in AWS CloudWatch.
