### **Title: User Authentication and Authorization**

User Role: As a User, I want to authenticate and be authorized so that I can securely access and perform actions within the application.

Functional Description:

The system will implement authentication using Keycloak, which will handle user login, session management, and role-based access control. This ensures that only authorized users can access specific features of the application, enhancing security and compliance with organizational policies.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the login page

WHEN I enter valid credentials and click "Login"

THEN I should be authenticated and redirected to the dashboard 

AND I should see features accessible based on my role

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to log in using their credentials via Keycloak.
- Session management should prevent unauthorized access.
- Users should only see features they have permission to access.
- The system must display an error message for invalid login attempts.
- Audit logs of login attempts should be stored in AWS CloudTrail.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Integrate Keycloak for authentication and session management.
- Modify API endpoints to check user roles and permissions.
- Store logs of authentication attempts in AWS CloudTrail.

Frontend Implications:

- Design and implement login UI using React.
- Manage user session state using React Context API.
- Conditionally render UI components based on user role.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Backend: Integrate Keycloak and configure roles and permissions.
- Backend: Implement middleware to check authentication and roles.
- Frontend: Build login component and manage session state.
- Frontend: Implement conditional rendering for role-based UI.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful login and redirection.
- Test failed login with invalid credentials.
- Test role-based access to different features.
- Test session timeout and reauthentication.
- Perform security tests for unauthorized access attempts.

### **Title: CSV Upload and Processing**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 200MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (200MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Catalog Search and Edit**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog entries so that I can efficiently manage product information.

Functional Description:

The system should provide a search functionality to query the product catalog and allow users to edit entries. Edits should be reflected in the PostgreSQL database and be accessible through the web interface.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I search for a product by NSN or keyword

THEN I should see a list of matching products

AND I can select a product to edit its details

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to search the catalog by NSN or keyword.
- Search results should display relevant product information.
- Users should be able to edit product details and save changes.
- Changes must be updated in the PostgreSQL database.
- The system should log edit actions for auditing.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search functionality in Node.js (Express).
- Create API endpoints for querying and updating catalog entries.
- Ensure data integrity and validation during updates.

Frontend Implications:

- Build a search component with real-time filtering in React.
- Design an editable form for catalog entries.
- Manage state using React Context API for search and edit actions.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement search bar and filtering.
- Frontend: Build editable form for product details.
- Backend: Create API for search and edit operations.
- Backend: Implement data validation for updates.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with various keywords.
- Test editing and saving product details.
- Test database updates and integrity.
- Test UI responsiveness and error handling.
- Perform security tests for edit actions.

### **Title: Catalog Download**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it with stakeholders.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file. The download feature should be accessible through the web interface and support large datasets efficiently.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click the "Download CSV" button

THEN the system should generate and download the catalog as a CSV file

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to download the catalog as a CSV file.
- The file should include all catalog entries and be formatted correctly.
