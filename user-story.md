### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can find specific product entries quickly.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search the catalog by different fields such as NSN, common name, or description. This functionality will enable efficient access to specific catalog entries.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page

WHEN I enter search criteria and click "Search"

THEN the system should display a list of matching catalog entries

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search should return results based on the input criteria.
- Results should be displayed within 2 seconds for typical queries.
- Users should be able to refine search results using additional filters.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop a search API in Node.js (Express) that queries PostgreSQL.
- Implement search logic with support for multiple criteria.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search input field and filters in React.
- Display search results in a table format with pagination.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build search input and result display components.
- Backend: Develop search API to query the database.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with different criteria.
- Test response time for search queries.
- Perform edge case tests with no results or invalid inputs.

### **Title: Download Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog so that I can have an offline copy for review and analysis.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog in CSV format. This feature provides offline access to the catalog data for further analysis and review.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page

WHEN I click the "Download" button

THEN the system should provide a CSV file containing the entire catalog

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download should generate a CSV file with all catalog entries.
- The file should be ready for download within 5 seconds.
- The system should handle large data sets efficiently.

Story Points: 2 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement a download API in Node.js (Express) to retrieve catalog data.
- Format the data as a CSV file for download.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a "Download" button in React.
- Handle file download initiation and completion.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Add a download button to the UI.
- Backend: Develop download API to generate CSV files.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test download functionality for different catalog sizes.
- Verify the integrity and format of the downloaded CSV file.
- Perform performance tests for large data sets.
