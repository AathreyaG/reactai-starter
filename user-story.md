### **Title: Search Product Catalog**###

User Role: As a GSA Acquisition Workforce member, I want to search the product catalog so that I can quickly find specific items using filters.

Functional Description:

The system should provide a search functionality that allows users to filter the product catalog by various fields such as NSN, common name, and description. This feature should return results quickly, even with a large dataset, and provide an intuitive interface for inputting search criteria.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page  
WHEN I enter a keyword into the search bar  
THEN the system should display a list of items matching the criteria  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search should handle queries by NSN, common name, and description.
- The search results must be returned within 2 seconds for a dataset of 2.5 million items.
- The UI should support pagination for large result sets.
- If no results are found, an appropriate message should be displayed.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search API endpoint using Node.js and Express.
- Optimize database queries for speed and efficiency using PostgreSQL indexes.
- Implement caching strategies to enhance performance (e.g., Redis).

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search bar component with auto-suggestions.
- Implement result rendering components with pagination controls.
- Manage state using React Context or Redux for search queries and results.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Develop search input and result display components.
- Frontend: Implement pagination and result filtering UI.
- Backend: Create and optimize search API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement caching for frequent queries.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid and edge case queries.
- Test performance for large datasets to ensure results within 2 seconds.
- Validate pagination and filtering on the client side.
- Perform security tests (e.g., SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update product information as needed.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit existing catalog entries directly from the product detail view. Changes should be validated and saved to the database, with the UI providing feedback on success or failure.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product detail  
WHEN I click "Edit" and modify the fields  
THEN the system should save the changes and update the catalog  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit all fields of a product entry.
- Changes must be validated before saving.
- Updates should reflect in the database immediately.
- An error message should be displayed if validation fails.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement update API endpoint for catalog entries.
- Validate incoming data against defined schema (using Joi).

Frontend Implications:

- Develop editable fields within the product detail component.
- Implement form validation and submission logic.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create editable form fields in product detail view.
- Frontend: Implement form validation and error handling.
- Backend: Develop update API endpoint.
- Backend: Integrate validation logic for data integrity.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality with valid and invalid data.
- Verify data integrity post-update in the database.
- Test user feedback for successful and failed edits.
- Perform negative testing for unauthorized access attempts.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the entire catalog as a CSV file so that I can share or archive the data.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog or a filtered subset as a CSV file. The download process should be efficient and handle large data volumes without performance degradation.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I click "Download as CSV"  
THEN the system should generate and download the file  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download must support the entire catalog or filtered results.
- CSV file format should adhere to standard specifications.
- File generation should not exceed 30 seconds for the entire dataset.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement CSV export API endpoint.
- Handle large data processing efficiently (consider AWS Lambda).

Frontend Implications:

- Develop download button and feedback mechanism.
- Implement client-side handling for file download.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement download button and user feedback.
- Backend: Develop CSV export logic.
- Backend: Optimize file generation for large datasets.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test download functionality for different data sizes.
- Validate CSV format and content accuracy.
- Test performance for large dataset exports.
- Perform security tests for data confidentiality during export.
