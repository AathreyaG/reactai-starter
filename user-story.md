### **Title: CSV File Upload for Catalog Population**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can efficiently populate and update the catalog database.

Functional Description:
The system should provide a capability for users to upload CSV files that contain catalog data. The backend will validate, parse, and store this data in a PostgreSQL database. The frontend should offer real-time feedback during the upload process and notify users of completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:
GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should validate the file, process it, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The application must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Log upload activities in AWS CloudWatch for auditing and debugging.

Story Points: 8 (Complex)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:
- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to handle CSV file uploads.
- Implement file validation and parsing logic.
- Use Sequelize ORM to store data into PostgreSQL.
- Enable asynchronous processing for large files using AWS Lambda for scalability.

Frontend Implications:
- Develop a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Display a progress bar and success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation for CSV format and size.

**Development Subtasks**:
- Frontend: Develop the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar and error handling mechanisms.
- Backend: Create an Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Persist data into PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status in AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:
- Test successful file upload with a valid CSV.
- Test invalid file formats (e.g., TXT, JSON).
- Test with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test handling of large files up to 100MB.
- Test database storage and query performance.
- Perform security testing against malicious file uploads and SQL injection attacks.

### **Title: Search Catalog Entries**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can quickly find specific entries based on criteria.

Functional Description:
The system should allow users to search the catalog using keywords or filters. This functionality should be responsive and allow users to find catalog entries efficiently.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:
GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I enter a search term and click "Search"  
THEN the system should return a list of entries that match the search criteria

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must allow searches by NSN, common name, and other relevant fields.
- Results should be returned within 2 seconds.
- Handle cases where no entries match the search criteria.

Story Points: 3 (Simple)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:
- Create a search API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Implement query logic using Sequelize ORM for efficient data retrieval.

Frontend Implications:
- Develop a search bar component using React.
- Display search results dynamically in a table or list format.

**Development Subtasks**:
- Frontend: Develop the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement dynamic result display.
- Backend: Create an Express API for search functionality.
- Backend: Implement search query logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:
- Test searches with existing catalog entries.
- Test searches with no matching entries.
- Validate search performance and response times.
- Conduct edge case testing with special characters in search terms.

### **Title: Delete Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to delete catalog entries so that I can remove outdated or incorrect information.

Functional Description:
The system should allow users to delete catalog entries. This action should be confirmed by the user to prevent accidental deletions.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:
GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry  
WHEN I click "Delete" and confirm  
THEN the entry should be removed from the catalog

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users must confirm deletion to prevent accidental removal.
- The system should immediately reflect the removal of the entry.
- Handle cases where the entry does not exist.

Story Points: 2 (Simple)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:
- Create a delete API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Implement logic to remove entries from PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM.

Frontend Implications:
- Add a "Delete" button to catalog entries in the UI.
- Implement a confirmation dialog for delete actions.

**Development Subtasks**:
- Frontend: Add the delete button component.
- Frontend: Implement confirmation dialog.
- Backend: Create an Express API for delete functionality.
- Backend: Implement logic for entry removal.

**Testing Subtasks**:
- Test successful deletion of catalog entries.
- Validate UI updates correctly after deletion.
- Test deletion attempts for non-existent entries.
- Perform security tests to ensure only authorized deletions occur.
