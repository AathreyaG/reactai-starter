### **Title: Upload CSV File**

**User Role:** As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

**Functional Description:**

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**

- **GIVEN** I am on the file upload page
- **WHEN** I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"
- **THEN** the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

**Story Points:** 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog Entries**

**User Role:** As a Catalog Manager, I want to search catalog entries so that I can find specific products quickly.

**Functional Description:**

The system should allow users to search catalog entries based on various fields such as NSN, Description, and Common Name. This feature enhances efficiency in managing and locating catalog products.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog search page
- **WHEN** I enter search criteria and click "Search"
- **THEN** the system should display matching catalog entries

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system must support searching by NSN, Description, and Common Name.
- Results should be displayed in a tabular format.
- If no results are found, an appropriate message must be displayed.

**Story Points:** 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an API endpoint to query catalog entries based on search criteria.
- Optimize database queries for performance.

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement a search bar with filters using React.
- Display search results in a table format.

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement result display table.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for search functionality.
- Backend: Optimize database query for search.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test search functionality with valid criteria.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test search performance with a large dataset.
- Perform edge case testing with partial and case-insensitive matches.

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry**

**User Role:** As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update product information easily.

**Functional Description:**

The system should allow users to modify existing catalog entries. This feature is crucial for maintaining up-to-date product information.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**

- **GIVEN** I am viewing a catalog entry
- **WHEN** I click "Edit" and modify the entry details
- **THEN** the system should update the entry in the database

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system must allow editing of NSN, Description, Price, and other fields.
- Changes must be saved to the database upon confirmation.
- Users should receive confirmation of successful update.

**Story Points:** 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an API endpoint to update catalog entries.
- Implement data validation before updating the database.

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement an editable form for catalog entry details.
- Provide feedback upon successful or failed updates.

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Build the edit form component.
- Frontend: Implement save and cancel functionality.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for updating entries.
- Backend: Validate input data before updating.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test editing functionality with valid data.
- Test validation with invalid data.
- Test database update performance.
- Perform edge case testing with simultaneous edits.

### **Title: Export Catalog Data**

**User Role:** As a Catalog Manager, I want to export catalog data so that I can share or backup product information efficiently.

**Functional Description:**

The system should allow users to export the entire catalog or filtered data into a downloadable CSV file. This feature supports data sharing and backup operations.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog page
- **WHEN** I select export options and click "Export"
- **THEN** the system should generate and download a CSV file

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system must allow exporting of the entire catalog or search results.
- The exported file must be in CSV format.
- Users should receive a confirmation upon successful export.

**Story Points:** 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an API endpoint to generate CSV files from catalog data.
- Implement logic to handle large data exports.

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement export options UI using React.
- Trigger file download upon successful export.

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Build export options UI.
- Frontend: Implement file download functionality.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for CSV generation.
- Backend: Optimize export logic for large datasets.
