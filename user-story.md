### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Manage Catalog Items**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to manage catalog items so that I can keep the product information up to date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to view, search, edit, and delete catalog items. The backend should support CRUD operations, and the frontend should provide a user-friendly interface for these interactions.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I perform a search or select an item
THEN I should be able to view, edit, or delete the catalog item

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to search for catalog items by any attribute.
- Users must be able to edit catalog item details.
- Users must be able to delete catalog items.
- Changes should be saved to the database immediately.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop CRUD API endpoints for catalog items.
- Implement search functionality using Sequelize queries.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a table view for catalog items using React.
- Implement search, edit, and delete functionalities.
- Apply form validation for editing catalog items.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the catalog table component.
- Frontend: Implement search functionality.
- Frontend: Implement edit and delete options.
- Backend: Develop CRUD API endpoints.
- Backend: Implement search query logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test viewing all catalog items.
- Test search functionality with various queries.
- Test editing a catalog item and saving changes.
- Test deleting a catalog item.
- Validate data integrity in the database after operations.

### **Title: Export Catalog Data**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to export catalog data so that I can share it with stakeholders or publish it to GSA marketplaces.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to export catalog data as a CSV file. The backend should handle the data compilation, and the frontend should provide a simple button to initiate the export.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click the "Export" button
THEN a CSV file of the current catalog data should be generated and downloaded

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must provide an "Export" button on the catalog management page.
- The exported file must be in CSV format and include all catalog items.
- The export process should not exceed 60 seconds.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for exporting catalog data.
- Implement data aggregation logic.

Frontend Implications:

- Add an "Export" button to the catalog management UI.
- Implement download functionality for the exported file.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Add "Export" button to UI.
- Frontend: Implement file download logic.
- Backend: Develop export API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement data aggregation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test exporting catalog data with different dataset sizes.
- Validate the format of the exported CSV file.
- Ensure all catalog items are included in the export.
- Test the export process under load conditions.
