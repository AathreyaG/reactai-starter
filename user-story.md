### **Title: Search Product Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the product catalog so that I can efficiently find specific products within the database.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search the product catalog using various filters such as NSN, common name, or description. The backend should support search queries and handle pagination to manage large sets of data efficiently.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page

WHEN I enter a search term and click "Search"

THEN the system should return a list of products matching the criteria, with pagination if there are more than 20 results

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search must support filters by NSN, common name, and description.
- The results should be returned within 3 seconds.
- The system should display results in pages of 20.
- If no results are found, a message "No products found" must be displayed.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement a search API endpoint in Node.js (Express) that queries the PostgreSQL database.
- Optimize queries to ensure search response time is under 3 seconds.
- Implement pagination logic in the API.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search bar and filter UI component using React.
- Implement pagination controls.
- Display search results dynamically and handle empty states.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement pagination controls.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle search requests.
- Backend: Implement database query logic for filtering and pagination.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid search terms.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test pagination with more than 20 results.
- Performance test to ensure response time under 3 seconds.

### **Title: Edit Product Details**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can update the catalog with the most current information.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit product details directly from the web interface. Changes should be validated and then updated in the PostgreSQL database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product's details

WHEN I click "Edit" and modify the fields

THEN the system should save the changes and update the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields such as common name, description, and price.
- Changes must be validated before saving.
- The system must confirm the update with a success message.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement an API endpoint for updating product details in Node.js (Express).
- Ensure data validation logic is in place before updating the database.

Frontend Implications:

- Create an editable form for product details using React.
- Implement state management to handle form changes and submission.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the product details form with editable fields.
- Frontend: Implement form validation.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle product updates.
- Backend: Implement data validation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality with valid and invalid data.
- Test database updates after editing.
- Test form validation and error messages.
- Test success message display upon completion.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can have an offline copy of the data.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire product catalog as a CSV file. The backend should generate the CSV dynamically from the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click "Download Catalog"

THEN the system should generate and download a CSV file containing all product data

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The CSV file must include all fields from the database.
- The download should initiate within 5 seconds.
- If there is an error, an appropriate message must be displayed.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to generate CSV files from database entries.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and CSV generation logic.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a download button in the UI.
- Implement feedback for download initiation and errors.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the download button component.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle CSV generation.
- Backend: Implement data retrieval and CSV formatting logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download with full catalog data.
- Test CSV format and data integrity.
- Test download initiation time.
- Test error handling during CSV generation or download.
