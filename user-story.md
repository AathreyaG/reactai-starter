### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog Entries**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search catalog entries so that I can quickly find specific items.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for catalog entries using keywords. The search should be fast and return relevant results based on the search criteria.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page

WHEN I enter a search term and press "Enter"

THEN the system should display a list of matching catalog entries

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search should return results within 3 seconds.
- The search results should be relevant to the search term.
- If no matches are found, a "No results found" message should be displayed.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for searching catalog entries.
- Implement search logic using Sequelize to query PostgreSQL.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a search bar UI component.
- Display search results in a table format using USWDS components.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement results display using USWDS components.
- Backend: Create API for search functionality.
- Backend: Implement search logic and optimize queries.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search with valid terms.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test search performance (response time).
- Test edge cases (special characters, SQL injection).

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update incorrect or outdated information.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit existing catalog entries directly from the search results. Changes should be saved to the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry

WHEN I click "Edit" and modify the details

THEN the system should save the changes and update the entry

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system should allow editing of all catalog fields.
- Changes should be saved to the database immediately.
- A success message should be displayed upon saving.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for updating catalog entries.
- Implement update logic using Sequelize to modify PostgreSQL data.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement an editable form for catalog entries.
- Display success/error messages upon save.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the editable form component.
- Frontend: Implement save and cancel buttons.
- Backend: Create API for update functionality.
- Backend: Implement update logic and validation.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing of all fields.
- Test saving changes to the database.
- Test form validation (required fields, data types).
- Test edge cases (concurrent edits, invalid data).

### **Title: Download Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the entire catalog so that I can have a local copy for offline use or sharing.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file. The download should be quick and include all current catalog data.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click "Download Catalog"

THEN the system should generate and download a CSV file containing all catalog entries

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download should start within 5 seconds.
- The CSV file should include all catalog fields.
- A success message should be displayed after download.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for generating the CSV file.
- Implement logic to fetch all catalog data and format it as CSV.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a download button on the catalog management page.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the download button component.
- Backend: Create API for CSV generation.
- Backend: Implement logic to export data as CSV.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download functionality.
- Test CSV content (all fields included).
- Test download performance (response time).
- Test edge cases (large catalog data).

### **Title: Delete Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to delete catalog entries so that I can remove outdated or incorrect items from the catalog.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to delete catalog entries directly from the search results. The deletion should be reflected in the database immediately.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry

WHEN I click "Delete" and confirm the action

THEN the system should remove the entry from the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system should prompt for confirmation before deletion.
