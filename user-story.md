### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during the upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search and Edit Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit the catalog items so that I can keep the product information up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search through catalog items and edit them directly from the search results. The backend should support efficient querying and updating of catalog items.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page  
WHEN I enter a search term and press "Search"  
THEN the system should display relevant catalog items  

GIVEN I have the search results  
WHEN I click on an item to edit  
THEN I should be able to update the item details  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search functionality must support filtering by multiple fields (e.g., NSN, common_name).
- Edits must be immediately reflected in the database.
- Users must receive confirmation upon successful edits.
- Search results should be paginated for efficiency.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop search API endpoints to query the database.
- Implement update logic for catalog items.
- Ensure data integrity and validation for updates.

Frontend Implications:

- Build a search interface with filter options.
- Implement an editable form for catalog items.
- Provide user feedback for successful/failed edits.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create search bar and filter UI components.
- Frontend: Implement result pagination.
- Backend: Develop search query logic.
- Backend: Implement update functionality for catalog items.
- Backend: Ensure data validation on updates.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search with different query parameters.
- Verify data correctness after edits.
- Check search performance with a large dataset.
- Test for response time and accuracy in search results.
- Ensure proper validation and error handling during updates.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the entire catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it externally.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file. The backend should compile and format the data into a CSV file, ensuring all fields are included.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page  
WHEN I click "Download"  
THEN the system should generate a CSV file of the entire catalog  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The CSV file must include all catalog fields.
- The download should initiate within 5 seconds.
- The system must handle large datasets without crashing.
- Users should be notified upon successful download initiation.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop an API endpoint to generate CSV from the database.
- Optimize database queries for large data extraction.
- Ensure proper CSV formatting.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a download button and initiate download upon click.
- Provide user feedback for download initiation.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Add a download button to the catalog page.
- Backend: Implement CSV generation logic.
- Backend: Optimize data retrieval queries.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download speed and accuracy.
- Verify CSV file format and completeness.
- Check system performance for large dataset downloads.
- Test error handling for download failures.

### **Title: Publish Catalog to GSA Marketplaces**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to publish the catalog to GSA marketplaces so that it can be accessible on platforms like FedMall or GSA Advantage.

Functional Description:

The system should provide an option to publish the catalog data to designated marketplaces. The backend should handle data conversion and communication with marketplace APIs.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the publish page  
WHEN I click "Publish"  
THEN the system should send the catalog data to the GSA marketplaces  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must convert data to the required marketplace format.
- Successful publication should be confirmed to the user.
- Errors during the process should be clearly communicated.
- Logs of publication attempts must be maintained for audit.

Story Points: 13 (Very high complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop API interactions with GSA marketplace endpoints.
- Implement data conversion logic for marketplace compatibility.
- Log publication attempts and outcomes.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a publish interface with status indicators.
- Inform users of successful or failed publishing attempts.

**Development Subtasks**:
