### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

- **GIVEN** I am on the file upload page  
- **WHEN** I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
- **THEN** the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

**Story Points**: 8 (Increased complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

**Backend Implications**:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

**Frontend Implications**:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Product Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the product catalog so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search through the product catalog using various criteria. The backend should handle search queries efficiently, and the UI should display search results in a user-friendly manner.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog search page  
- **WHEN** I enter search criteria and click "Search"  
- **THEN** the system should return a list of products matching the criteria  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support searching by NSN, common_name, and Description.
- Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds.
- If no products match the criteria, a "No results found" message must be displayed.

**Story Points**: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

**Backend Implications**:

- Create an API endpoint for handling search queries.
- Implement efficient querying using PostgreSQL.

**Frontend Implications**:

- Develop a search input and results display UI using React.
- Implement client-side validation for search inputs.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search input component.
- Frontend: Implement results display and pagination.
- Backend: Create Express API for search queries.
- Backend: Optimize database queries for performance.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid and invalid inputs.
- Test performance of search queries.
- Test edge cases with no matching results.
- Conduct usability tests on search UI.

### **Title: Edit Product Details**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can ensure the catalog data is accurate and up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit details of products in the catalog. The backend should handle updates securely, and the UI should provide an intuitive editing interface.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

- **GIVEN** I am viewing a product's details  
- **WHEN** I make changes to the product information and click "Save"  
- **THEN** the system should update the product details in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit NSN, common_name, Description, Price, and UI fields.
- Changes must be saved to the database within 2 seconds.
- A confirmation message must be displayed upon successful update.

**Story Points**: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

**Backend Implications**:

- Create an API endpoint for updating product details.
- Implement update logic using Sequelize ORM.

**Frontend Implications**:

- Develop a form UI for editing product details using React.
- Implement client-side validation for form inputs.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the product details form component.
- Frontend: Implement form validation and error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API for updating product details.
- Backend: Implement update logic in PostgreSQL.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality with valid and invalid inputs.
- Test performance of update operations.
- Test edge cases with incomplete data.
- Conduct usability tests on the edit UI.

### **Title: Export Catalog Data**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to export catalog data so that I can share it with external stakeholders or systems.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to export the product catalog as a CSV file. The backend should generate the CSV efficiently, and the UI should provide a simple export interface.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog management page  
- **WHEN** I click "Export"  
- **THEN** the system should generate a CSV file of the current catalog and start a download  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The exported CSV must include all product fields.
- The CSV generation process must be completed within 5 seconds.
- Users must be notified if the export fails.

**Story Points**: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

**Backend Implications**:

- Create an API endpoint for exporting catalog data.
- Implement CSV generation logic using Node.js.

**Frontend Implications**:

- Develop an export button UI using React.
- Implement client-side handling of CSV download.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the export button component.
- Frontend: Implement download handling and notifications.
- Backend: Create Express API for CSV export.
- Backend: Implement CSV generation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful export of catalog data.
- Test performance of CSV generation.
- Test edge cases with large data volumes.
