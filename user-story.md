### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search and Edit Catalog Entries**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog entries so that I can update product information efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search catalog entries using filters and edit selected entries. This enhances data accuracy and facilitates easy updates.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page

WHEN I enter search criteria and submit the search  
THEN the system should display a list of matching entries

WHEN I select an entry and edit its details  
THEN the system should update the entry in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search functionality must support filters like NSN, common name, and description.
- Edits should be reflected in the database immediately.
- User feedback (success/failure messages) must be provided for edits.
- Changes must be logged for audit purposes.

Story Points: 8 (Higher complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoints for search and update operations.
- Implement search filters using Sequelize.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity during edits.
- Log changes to AWS CloudWatch for auditing.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a search form with filter options using React.
- Display search results in a table with pagination.
- Implement an edit form with validation for entry updates.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search form and results table.
- Frontend: Build the edit form with validation.
- Backend: Create API endpoints for search and update.
- Backend: Implement logging for changes.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search with various filters.
- Test editing entries with valid/invalid data.
- Test response time and data consistency.
- Perform security testing on search and edit operations.

### **Title: Download Catalog Data**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download catalog data so that I can analyze or archive it offline.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog or filtered entries in CSV format. This facilitates offline analysis and record keeping.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page

WHEN I click the "Download" button  
THEN the system should generate a CSV file of the catalog data for download

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download feature must support exporting all data or filtered data.
- The CSV file should be well-formatted and include all relevant fields.
- User feedback must be provided upon download initiation and completion.
- Download logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint to generate CSV files from database entries.
- Implement filtering logic for partial downloads.
- Log download requests and results.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a download button linked to the endpoint.
- Provide download status feedback to the user.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement the download button and feedback.
- Backend: Create the API endpoint for CSV generation.
- Backend: Implement filtering logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test full and partial downloads.
- Verify CSV format and content.
- Test download initiation and completion feedback.
- Perform security testing on download operations.

These user stories are aligned with the MVP plan, focusing on core functionalities of upload, search, edit, and download for the GSA Supply Catalog Management Platform.
