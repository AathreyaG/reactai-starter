### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should enable users to search the product catalog using various criteria such as NSN or common name. The search results should be displayed in a user-friendly list format, allowing for easy navigation and selection.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page  
WHEN I enter a search query in the search bar and press "Enter"  
THEN the system should display the matching products in the catalog list  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search functionality must support criteria like NSN and common name.
- Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds.
- No results found message should be displayed if the search yields no products.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint to handle search queries.
- Implement query logic to search the database efficiently.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a search bar UI using React.
- Display search results dynamically as the user types.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement real-time search result display.
- Backend: Create API to handle search queries.
- Backend: Optimize database queries for fast search.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search with valid criteria (NSN, common name).
- Test search with invalid criteria.
- Test search with no results.
- Test performance of search queries.

### **Title: Edit Product Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can keep the catalog information accurate and up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit product details directly from the catalog interface. Changes should be validated and updated in the database upon confirmation.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page  
WHEN I select a product and click "Edit"  
THEN I should be able to modify the product details and save the changes  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields like common name, description, and price.
- Changes must be reflected in the database immediately upon saving.
- An error message should be displayed if validation fails.

Story Points: 8 (Complex)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoints for updating product details.
- Implement validation logic for product data.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement an editable form UI using React.
- Provide feedback for successful updates or validation errors.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the editable product form.
- Frontend: Implement validation and error handling.
- Backend: Create API endpoints for product updates.
- Backend: Implement data validation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing with valid inputs.
- Test editing with invalid inputs.
- Test database update on successful edit.
- Test feedback for validation errors.
