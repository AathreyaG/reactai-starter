### **Title: Search Product Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the product catalog so that I can quickly find and manage specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search the product catalog by National Stock Number (NSN) or common name. This functionality will help users efficiently locate specific products for editing or review.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I enter a valid NSN or common name into the search bar and press "Search"

THEN the system should display a list of products matching the search criteria

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search functionality must return results within 2 seconds for up to 10,000 products.
- Users must be able to search by both NSN and common name.
- The system should display a "No results found" message if no matches are detected.
- Search results should update dynamically as the user types (using debouncing to optimize performance).

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement a search API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Optimize database queries using indexes on NSN and common_name columns in PostgreSQL.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a search bar component using React.
- Utilize state management to handle search input and results display.
- Implement dynamic search results display with debouncing.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement dynamic results display with debouncing.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle search queries.
- Backend: Optimize database indexing for efficient search.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful search by NSN and common name.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test performance with large datasets.
- Test edge cases with partial inputs.
- Perform security tests to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

### **Title: Edit Product Details**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can keep the catalog up-to-date with the latest information.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit the details of a product directly from the catalog management interface. Edited details should be validated and updated in the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product in the catalog

WHEN I click "Edit" and modify the product details

THEN the system should validate the inputs and update the product information in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit all fields except NSN.
- Changes should be validated before saving.
- The system should provide confirmation of successful updates.
- Updates must reflect in the database immediately.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement an API endpoint for updating product details.
- Validate input data before committing changes to the database.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement an editable form within the product detail view using React.
- Provide real-time validation feedback to users during editing.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create the editable form component.
- Frontend: Implement real-time validation and confirmation messages.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for updating product details.
- Backend: Implement data validation before updating records.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful updates with valid data.
- Test validation with invalid inputs (e.g., missing required fields).
- Test edge cases such as extremely long text inputs.
- Verify database update operations.
- Check for security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized updates.
