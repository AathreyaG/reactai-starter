### **Title: CSV File Upload**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Catalog Search and Edit**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog entries to ensure data accuracy and relevance.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for catalog entries and make edits as necessary. The frontend should offer a user-friendly search interface, and the backend should efficiently handle search queries and updates to the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I enter a search term and click "Search"  
THEN the system should return matching catalog entries  

GIVEN I have a list of catalog entries  
WHEN I click "Edit" on an entry and make changes  
THEN the system should update the entry in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search functionality should return results that match the query.
- Edits to catalog entries should be reflected in the database.
- Changes should be logged for auditing purposes.
- The user should receive a confirmation message upon successful edit.

Story Points: 3 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search logic in Node.js to query PostgreSQL.
- Create API endpoints for search and edit operations.
- Ensure data consistency and concurrency handling during edits.

Frontend Implications:

- Design a search bar and results table in React.
- Implement inline editing capabilities with form validation.
- Provide user feedback for search results and edit confirmations.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar and results table.
- Frontend: Implement inline editing functionality.
- Backend: Create API endpoints for search and edit.
- Backend: Implement search query logic.
- Backend: Ensure data consistency during edit operations.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test various search queries (exact match, partial match).
- Test edit functionality for different fields.
- Ensure data consistency with concurrent edits.
- Validate user feedback messages for search and edit operations.
- Perform security tests (SQL injection, unauthorized access).

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file for offline analysis and sharing.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file. The backend should generate this file dynamically based on the current database state, and the frontend should offer a simple download interface.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I click "Download"  
THEN the system should generate and download the catalog as a CSV file  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download should include all current catalog entries.
- The CSV format should match the upload template.
- The download process should be efficient and user-friendly.
- Users should receive a confirmation notification upon download completion.

Story Points: 2 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement logic in Node.js to export catalog data to CSV format.
- Create an API endpoint for initiating the download.

Frontend Implications:

- Add a download button to the catalog management interface.
- Provide user feedback during the download process.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Add download button and feedback notification.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for catalog export.
- Backend: Implement CSV generation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download for different catalog sizes.
- Validate CSV format and content.
- Ensure download efficiency and user experience.
- Perform security tests (ensure only authorized downloads).
