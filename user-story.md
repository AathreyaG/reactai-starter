### **Title: CSV File Upload and Validation**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can efficiently populate the catalog database with new product data.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend will validate the file's structure, parse its content, and store the data in PostgreSQL. The UI will provide real-time feedback during the upload and notify users upon completion or if there are errors in the file.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously using AWS Lambda.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show a progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Basic Search Functionality for Product Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the product catalog so that I can quickly find specific products to view or edit.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search the product catalog using various filters such as NSN, common name, or description. The search results should be displayed in a paginated table format with options for sorting.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the product catalog page

WHEN I enter search criteria and click "Search"
THEN the system should display a list of products matching the criteria

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support searches by NSN, common name, and description.
- Search results should be displayed in a paginated table.
- Users should be able to sort results by any visible column.
- The system should return search results within 2 seconds for typical queries.

Story Points: 3 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search API in Node.js (Express).
- Ensure efficient querying of PostgreSQL for search criteria.
- Implement sorting and pagination logic in API.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search bar and filters using React.
- Display results in a table with pagination and sorting.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build search bar and filter components.
- Frontend: Implement table component for displaying results.
- Backend: Create search API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement sorting and pagination logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with various criteria.
- Test edge cases (e.g., no results found, maximum result set).
- Test sort and pagination features.
- Perform performance testing to ensure response time.

### **Title: Edit Product Details**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can ensure the catalog data is accurate and up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit details of a product, such as its description, price, and UI. Changes should be saved to the database and reflected in the catalog view.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product's details

WHEN I make changes and click "Save"
THEN the system should update the product details in the database and reflect the changes in the UI

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields like description, price, and UI.
- Changes must be saved in PostgreSQL.
- The UI must reflect changes immediately after saving.
- System must validate input data before saving.

Story Points: 3 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement update API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Ensure data validation and integrity checks.

Frontend Implications:

- Create product detail view with editable fields using React.
- Implement form validation and submit logic.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build product detail view component.
- Frontend: Implement form validation and submission logic.
- Backend: Create update API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement data validation and integrity checks.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality with valid and invalid input.
- Test database update operation and data consistency.
- Perform UI tests to ensure changes reflect immediately.
- Conduct negative tests (e.g., unauthorized edits).

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can have an offline copy of the product data.

Functional Description:

The system should enable users to download the entire product catalog as a CSV file. The file should be generated on-demand and include all relevant product data fields.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page

WHEN I click "Download as CSV"
THEN the system should generate a CSV file containing the product data and initiate a download

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The downloaded file must include all product data fields.
- The download process must complete within 5 seconds for typical catalog sizes.
- The system must handle concurrent download requests efficiently.

Story Points: 2 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement CSV export API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and CSV generation.

Frontend Implications:

- Add a download button to the catalog page using React.
- Handle file download initiation and user interactions.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement download button in catalog page.
- Backend: Create CSV export API endpoint.
- Backend: Optimize data retrieval for CSV generation.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download functionality.
- Verify CSV file content and format.
- Perform performance testing for download process.
- Conduct concurrent download tests.
