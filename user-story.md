### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

- Backend Implications:
  - Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
  - Implement file validation & parsing logic.
  - Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
  - Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

- Frontend Implications:
  - Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
  - Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
  - Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search and Edit Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog entries so that I can manage product data effectively.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for catalog entries using various parameters and edit existing entries. This feature should ensure data accuracy and completeness.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I input search criteria and submit the search

THEN the system should display matching catalog entries

AND WHEN I edit an entry and save

THEN the system should update the database with the new information

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support search by NSN, common name, and other relevant fields.
- Edited entries must be validated and saved to the database.
- The system should provide real-time feedback on search and edit operations.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

- Backend Implications:
  - Create API endpoints for searching and updating catalog entries.
  - Implement validation logic for edits.
  - Ensure data consistency and integrity in PostgreSQL.

- Frontend Implications:
  - Develop a search interface with filters.
  - Implement inline editing capability for search results.
  - Provide real-time feedback on search results and edit operations.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search interface and filters.
- Frontend: Implement inline editing for catalog entries.
- Backend: Create API for search functionalities.
- Backend: Implement update logic with data validation.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with various parameters.
- Test successful and unsuccessful edit operations.
- Validate data consistency post-edit.
- Test edge cases and error scenarios for search and edit.

### **Title: Download Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the entire catalog so that I can have an offline backup or share it with stakeholders.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog in a predefined format. This feature ensures data accessibility and sharing capabilities.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click the "Download" button

THEN the system should generate and provide a downloadable file containing the full catalog

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must generate a downloadable file in CSV format.
- The download operation should be seamless and efficient.
- Logs of download operations must be maintained for auditing.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

- Backend Implications:
  - Implement logic to generate the catalog file from the database.
  - Create an API endpoint for download requests.

- Frontend Implications:
  - Add a "Download" button to the catalog management interface.
  - Handle user interactions and feedback for the download operation.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Add download button and handle interactions.
- Backend: Create API to generate and serve the downloadable file.
- Backend: Log download operations for auditing.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test download functionality for various catalog sizes.
- Verify file format and data completeness.
- Perform load testing for concurrent download requests.

By following these structured user stories and tasks, the development team can efficiently execute the MVP plan with high quality and within the stipulated time frame.
