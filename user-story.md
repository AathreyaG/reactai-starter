### **Title: Upload CSV File**

**User Role:**  
As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

**Functional Description:**  
The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**  

- **GIVEN** I am on the file upload page  
- **WHEN** I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
- **THEN** the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

**Story Points:** 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog Entries**

**User Role:**  
As a Catalog Manager, I want to search catalog entries efficiently so that I can quickly find specific products.

**Functional Description:**  
The system should allow users to search catalog entries by NSN or common name. The backend should support query operations, and the frontend should display search results in a user-friendly table format.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**  

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog management page  
- **WHEN** I enter a search term and press "Search"  
- **THEN** the system should display a list of matching catalog entries  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can search by NSN or common name.
- Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds.
- The system should handle special characters and partial matches.
- If no results are found, display a "No results" message.

**Story Points:** 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create a search API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Implement query logic in PostgreSQL.
- Optimize query performance for quick retrieval.

**Frontend Implications:**

- Build a search bar component in React.
- Display results in a table with pagination.

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Create search bar and results table.
- Backend: Implement search API endpoint.
- Backend: Optimize database queries for search.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test search functionality with valid inputs.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test handling of special characters.
- Test performance of search operations.

### **Title: Export Catalog as CSV**

**User Role:**  
As a Catalog Manager, I want to export the entire catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it with other platforms.

**Functional Description:**  
The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file. The backend should handle data extraction and file generation, while the frontend should provide a download link.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario:**  

- **GIVEN** I am on the catalog management page  
- **WHEN** I click "Export to CSV"  
- **THEN** the system should generate and download the catalog as a CSV file  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can download the catalog in CSV format.
- The file should include all product entries.
- Download should start within 3 seconds after the request.

**Story Points:** 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Backend Implications:**

- Create an export API endpoint in Node.js (Express).
- Implement logic to extract data and format it as CSV.

**Frontend Implications:**

- Implement an "Export" button in the UI.

**Development Subtasks:**

- Frontend: Add "Export to CSV" button.
- Backend: Implement CSV generation logic.
- Backend: Create export API endpoint.

**Testing Subtasks:**

- Test successful CSV export.
- Test CSV file format and content.
- Verify file download performance.

These user stories are designed to meet CMMI Level 5 standards, ensuring a comprehensive and detailed approach to development and testing.

**Note:** A new user story for deleting catalog entries needs to be added.
