### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search for products in the catalog so that I can quickly find specific items.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for products in the catalog by NSN or common name. The search results should be displayed in a paginated format for easy navigation.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I enter a search term like NSN or common name

THEN the system should display matching products in a paginated list

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must allow search by NSN and common name.
- Search results should be returned within 2 seconds.
- Paginated results must be displayed with a maximum of 20 items per page.
- Users should be able to navigate through pages of results.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search logic in Node.js to query PostgreSQL database.
- Optimize database queries for performance.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement search input field and results display using React.
- Implement pagination controls for navigating search results.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar and results display component.
- Frontend: Implement pagination controls.
- Backend: Implement search query logic in Express.
- Backend: Optimize query performance for fast results.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search by NSN and common name.
- Test pagination functionality.
- Test performance of search results retrieval.
- Test edge cases (e.g., no results found, special characters in search).

### **Title: Edit Product Details**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can update the catalog with accurate information.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit details of products in the catalog. Changes should be saved to the database and reflected in the UI.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product's details

WHEN I edit the product information and save changes

THEN the system should update the database and reflect changes in the UI

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must allow editing of all product fields (e.g., NSN, common name, description).
- Changes must be saved to the PostgreSQL database.
- The UI should reflect updated product details immediately upon saving.
- An error message should be displayed if saving fails.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoints for updating product details in Node.js.
- Ensure database integrity and security when updating records.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement editable fields in the product detail view using React.
- Provide feedback to users upon saving changes.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build editable fields in the product detail component.
- Frontend: Implement save button and feedback messages.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for updating product details.
- Backend: Implement data validation and integrity checks.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing and saving product details.
- Test database updates and data integrity.
- Test UI feedback on successful and failed saves.
- Test edge cases (e.g., empty fields, invalid data input).

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the entire catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it with stakeholders.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire product catalog as a CSV file. The download should be initiated from the UI and handled by the backend.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click the "Download as CSV" button

THEN the system should generate and download the catalog as a CSV file

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must generate a CSV file containing all catalog data.
- Download should be initiated within 3 seconds.
- CSV file must include all product fields.
- An error message should be displayed if download fails.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoint in Node.js to generate CSV from database records.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and CSV generation.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement download button and handle download initiation using React.
- Provide feedback to users upon download completion or failure.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the download button and feedback messages.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for generating CSV files.
- Backend: Implement efficient data retrieval and CSV export logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test download initiation and completion.
- Verify CSV file content and format.
- Test error handling in case of download failure.
- Test performance of CSV generation and download.
