### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The search functionality allows users to query the catalog database for specific products using different filters like NSN, common name, or description. This feature enhances user efficiency in managing and accessing catalog data.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page  
WHEN I enter a search term or filter criteria  
THEN the system should display the relevant catalog entries  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must allow searching by NSN, common name, and description.
- Results should be displayed in a paginated format.
- The search should return results within 2 seconds.
- Logs of search queries should be stored in AWS CloudWatch.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement a REST API endpoint for search queries.
- Optimize database queries for fast retrieval.
- Log search queries for analysis.

Frontend Implications:

- Develop a search bar and filter UI components.
- Display search results in a paginated table.
- Implement loading indicators during search.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create search bar and filter interface.
- Frontend: Implement result pagination.
- Backend: Develop search API endpoint.
- Backend: Optimize search query performance.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid and invalid terms.
- Test pagination and filter combinations.
- Validate response times under load.
- Check query logging accuracy.

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update product information as needed.

Functional Description:

This feature allows users to edit existing catalog entries to keep the product information accurate and up-to-date. It ensures that any changes are immediately reflected in the catalog database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry  
WHEN I select the edit option and modify the details  
THEN the system should update the entry in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields like common name, description, and price.
- Changes should be saved to the database immediately.
- The UI should confirm successful updates.
- Logs of changes should be stored in AWS CloudWatch.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for updating catalog entries.
- Implement data validation for updated fields.
- Log changes for audit purposes.

Frontend Implications:

- Develop an edit form with validation.
- Implement user feedback for successful/failed updates.
- Handle state updates for edited entries.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Design and implement the edit form UI.
- Frontend: Add validation for form fields.
- Backend: Develop API endpoint for updates.
- Backend: Implement change logging.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test field validations and error handling.
- Verify database updates for edited entries.
- Check UI feedback for successful updates.
- Test audit logging accuracy.

### **Title: Publish Catalog to GSA Marketplace**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to publish the catalog to the GSA marketplace so that it is available to federal buyers.

Functional Description:

This feature enables users to publish the entire catalog or selected entries to the GSA marketplace, ensuring the products are accessible to authorized federal buyers. The operation should handle data export and integration with GSA systems.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I have selected catalog entries  
WHEN I initiate the publish action  
THEN the system should export the entries to the GSA marketplace  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support full and partial catalog publishing.
- Successful integration with GSA APIs for data transmission.
- Confirmation of successful publishing should be provided.
- Logs of publishing activities should be stored in AWS CloudWatch.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Develop integration with GSA APIs for catalog publishing.
- Implement data export logic and error handling.
- Log publishing activities for compliance.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a publish UI component with selection options.
- Provide feedback on publishing status.
- Manage state changes post-publishing.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create UI for entry selection and publish action.
- Backend: Implement GSA API integration.
