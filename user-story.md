### **Title: Upload CSV File** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 8 (Increased complexity due to additional features)

**Enhancements to Increase Complexity**:

1. **Data Transformation and Enrichment**:
   - Implement logic to transform data from the CSV file into a different format before storing it in the database.
   - Integrate with external APIs to enrich the data with additional information.

2. **Advanced Error Handling and Reporting**:
   - Provide detailed error reports for failed uploads, including line numbers and specific issues in the CSV file.
   - Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors.

3. **User Notifications and Alerts**:
   - Send email notifications to users upon successful or failed uploads.
   - Implement real-time alerts using WebSockets to notify users of upload status changes.

4. **Enhanced Security Measures**:
   - Integrate a file scanning service to check for malware in the uploaded CSV files.
   - Implement data anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.

5. **Scalability and Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement load balancing to distribute upload requests across multiple servers.
   - Use caching strategies to optimize data retrieval and reduce database load.

6. **Comprehensive Logging and Analytics**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for all stages of the upload process.
   - Develop an analytics dashboard to provide insights into upload trends and performance metrics.

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation, parsing, transformation, and enrichment logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).
- Implement security measures and logging.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar, success/failure messages, and real-time alerts.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar, error handling, and real-time alerts.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing, transformation, and enrichment logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch and implement security measures.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).
- Test retry mechanism and detailed error reporting.
- Test user notifications and real-time alerts.

### **Title: Search Catalog** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can easily find specific products.

Functional Description:

The application should provide a search feature that allows users to search the catalog by NSN or common name. The results should be displayed in a paginated format.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog page

WHEN I enter a search term and press "Search"

THEN the system should display search results matching the term in a paginated format

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support search by NSN and common name.
- Results should be displayed in pages with a maximum of 20 items per page.
- A "No results found" message must be shown if no matches are found.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint to query the catalog data.
- Implement search logic to filter results based on NSN or common name.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a search input and button in the React UI.
- Display search results in a paginated table.
- Implement state management for search results.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement paginated results display.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for catalog search.
- Backend: Implement search filtering logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid terms.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test pagination display and navigation.
- Test search performance with large datasets.

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry** ###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update product information as needed.

Functional Description:

The application should allow users to edit existing catalog entries. Changes should be immediately reflected in the database and be visible to other users.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry

WHEN I edit the entry and save changes

THEN the system should update the catalog entry in the database and display a confirmation message

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users can modify all fields except NSN.
- Changes must be saved to the database immediately.
- A success message should confirm the update.
- Validation must ensure no empty fields are submitted.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint for updating catalog entries.
- Implement validation logic to ensure data integrity.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement an editable form for catalog entries.
- Provide feedback for successful updates or errors.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Create editable form for catalog entries.
- Frontend: Implement validation and user feedback.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for updating entries.
- Backend: Implement update logic and validation.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing with valid data.
- Test validation with missing fields.
- Test database update and confirmation message.
- Test concurrent edits by multiple users.
