### **Title: CSV File Upload Functionality**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can efficiently populate and update the catalog database.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload CSV files containing catalog data. The backend will validate, parse, and store the data in a PostgreSQL database. The UI should provide feedback during the upload process and notify users when it is complete.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the CSV upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search and Edit Catalog Items**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search and edit catalog items to keep the catalog data accurate and up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for catalog items by various attributes and edit existing entries. The edits should be saved to the PostgreSQL database, ensuring data is current and correct.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I search for a product and edit its details

THEN the system should update the product information in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to search products by NSN, common name, and other relevant fields.
- Users must be able to edit product details and save changes.
- Changes must reflect in the database immediately.
- Search results should be paginated for better performance.

Story Points: 8 (High complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement search logic in API to query PostgreSQL.
- Create CRUD endpoints for updating product details.
- Ensure data integrity and version control during edits.

Frontend Implications:

- Build a search interface with filters using React.
- Implement edit functionality with form validation.
- Display confirmation messages upon successful edits.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search interface with filters.
- Frontend: Implement editing form with validation.
- Backend: Develop search API querying PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Create endpoints for updating product data.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with different queries.
- Test editing product details and saving changes.
- Validate data integrity after edits.
- Test pagination for large result sets.
- Perform security tests (unauthorized access, data leaks).

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file for offline use and sharing with stakeholders.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog or selected items as a CSV file. This feature will facilitate offline access to catalog data and sharing with external parties.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click on the "Download CSV" button

THEN the system should generate and download the CSV file containing the selected catalog data

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to download the entire catalog or filtered results.
- The CSV file should include all relevant fields.
- Download should be initiated quickly and reliably.
- Logs of download actions must be stored in AWS CloudWatch.

Story Points: 3 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement API endpoint to generate CSV files from PostgreSQL data.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and CSV generation.
- Log download activities for auditing.

Frontend Implications:

- Add "Download CSV" button to the UI.
- Implement client-side logic to handle download requests.
- Display notifications for download success/failure.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement "Download CSV" button.
- Frontend: Handle download initiation and notifications.
- Backend: Develop CSV generation logic.
- Backend: Implement API endpoint for downloading CSV files.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download functionality for the entire catalog.
- Test CSV download for filtered results.
- Validate CSV file format and content integrity.
- Perform load tests for large data downloads.
- Verify logging of download actions.

### **Title: Basic UI Design using USWDS Components**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want a user-friendly interface to interact with the catalog application efficiently.

Functional Description:

The application should feature a minimalistic and functional user interface using USWDS components to ensure compliance with federal design standards and enhance user experience.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am using the catalog application

WHEN I navigate through different pages

THEN the system should provide a consistent and intuitive user interface

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- UI must be built using USWDS components.
- Ensure consistency in design across all pages.
- UI should be responsive and accessible.
- Feedback and error messages should be clear and concise.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Frontend Implications:

- Use USWDS components for UI consistency.
- Ensure responsive design for various devices.
- Implement state management for user interactions.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Implement USWDS component-based design.
- Ensure responsive layout across pages.
- Integrate state management for UI components.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Validate UI consistency across different pages.
- Test responsiveness on various devices.
- Check accessibility compliance.
- Verify clarity of feedback and error messages.
