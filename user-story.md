### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog by NSN or common name to quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should provide search functionality to allow users to find catalog items based on NSN or common name, enabling efficient management and updates of product information.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog search page
WHEN I enter an NSN or common name in the search bar
THEN the system should display matching catalog items

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search should return results within 2 seconds.
- The search must be case-insensitive.
- If no matches are found, display a "No results found" message.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement a search API endpoint in Node.js.
- Optimize database queries for quick search results.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a search bar component in React.
- Display search results in a paginated list.
- Show a loading indicator while searching.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement paginated results display.
- Backend: Create search API endpoint.
- Backend: Optimize database queries.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid NSN and common names.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test performance for large datasets.
- Conduct security tests (SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Edit Product Details**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can keep the catalog information accurate and up-to-date.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to view and edit details of individual products, ensuring the catalog is accurate and reflects current information.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on a product's detail page
WHEN I edit the product information and click "Save"
THEN the system should update the product details in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must save changes within 2 seconds.
- Provide confirmation upon successful update.
- If the update fails, display an error message.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement an API endpoint for updating product details.
- Ensure data validation and integrity checks.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a product detail view with editable fields.
- Implement save functionality and feedback messages.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the product detail view.
- Frontend: Implement edit and save functionality.
- Backend: Create update API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement data validation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing and saving product details.
- Test validation for invalid data entries.
- Test performance for high-frequency updates.
- Conduct security tests (data validation, input sanitization).

### **Title: Download Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can analyze and share the information easily.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire catalog as a CSV file, facilitating easy data analysis and sharing with stakeholders.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page
WHEN I click the "Download" button
THEN the system should generate and download the catalog as a CSV file

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download should start within 3 seconds.
- The CSV file must contain all catalog entries.
- If the download fails, display an error message.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Implement an API endpoint for CSV generation.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and file generation.

Frontend Implications:

- Create a download button on the catalog management page.
- Provide feedback on download initiation and completion.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Implement the download button.
- Frontend: Handle user feedback for downloads.
- Backend: Create CSV generation API endpoint.
- Backend: Optimize data retrieval for large datasets.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful CSV downloads.
- Test performance for large catalogs.
- Test error handling for download failures.
- Conduct security tests (authorization, data exposure).
