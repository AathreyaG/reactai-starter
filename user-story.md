### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Product Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the product catalog so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search for products in the catalog using criteria such as NSN or common name. The backend should query the PostgreSQL database to retrieve matching records, and the UI should display the results in a user-friendly manner.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the product catalog page

WHEN I enter a search term and click "Search"

THEN the system should display a list of products matching the search criteria

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support search by NSN and common name.
- Search results should be displayed within 3 seconds for typical queries.
- If no products match the search criteria, an appropriate message should be displayed.

Story Points: 3 (Low to moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoint for searching products.
- Implement search logic using Sequelize to query PostgreSQL.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement search bar UI component.
- Display search results and handle no-match scenarios.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build search bar and results display components.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for product search.
- Backend: Implement search functionality.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search with valid NSN.
- Test search with valid common name.
- Test search with no matching results.
- Test performance for large datasets.

### **Title: Edit Product Details**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details so that I can update the catalog with accurate information.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit product details from the catalog. The backend should update the PostgreSQL database with the new information, and the UI should reflect the changes in real-time.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a product's details

WHEN I edit the product information and click "Save"

THEN the system should update the product details in the database and display a confirmation message

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields like common name, description, price, UI, and AAC.
- Changes should be saved to the database with a confirmation message displayed.
- Data validation should be performed to ensure data integrity.

Story Points: 3 (Low to moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoint for updating product details.
- Implement update logic using Sequelize to modify PostgreSQL records.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement product details form and handle state changes.
- Display confirmation message upon successful update.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build product details form UI.
- Frontend: Handle form submission and state management.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for product updates.
- Backend: Implement update logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing of each product field.
- Test saving updates to the database.
- Test data validation and error handling.
- Test UI updates and confirmation messages.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it or use it offline.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the entire product catalog as a CSV file. The backend should generate the CSV format from the PostgreSQL database, and the UI should prompt the user to download the file.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click "Download CSV"

THEN the system should generate and prompt me to download the catalog in CSV format

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The CSV file must contain all product data from the catalog.
- The download should start within 5 seconds of the request.
- The file must be in a standard CSV format.

Story Points: 2 (Low complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoint to generate CSV file.
- Implement logic to retrieve data from PostgreSQL and format as CSV.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement download button UI component.
- Handle file download initiation.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build download button component.
- Backend: Create API endpoint for CSV generation.
- Backend: Implement data retrieval and CSV formatting logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV file generation.
- Test download initiation and file integrity.
- Test performance and timing for large datasets.
