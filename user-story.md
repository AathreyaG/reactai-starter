### **Title: Upload CSV File**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page  
WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"  
THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Display Catalog Data**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to view the uploaded catalog data in a table format so that I can easily understand and manage the data.

Functional Description:

The system should display the uploaded catalog data in a tabular format using a React component. The table should support pagination, sorting, and basic filtering of the products.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I have uploaded a CSV file  
WHEN I navigate to the catalog data page  
THEN I should see the data displayed in a table with pagination and sorting options  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The table should display all relevant columns from the CSV.
- Sorting should be available for all columns.
- Pagination should be implemented for large datasets.
- Basic filtering by NSN or common name should be available.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- No additional backend changes are required for displaying data.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a CatalogTable component using React.
- Ensure the table supports sorting and pagination.
- Add filtering capabilities for specific columns.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Develop the CatalogTable component.
- Frontend: Implement sorting and pagination.
- Frontend: Add basic filtering functionality.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test data display accuracy.
- Test sorting functionality.
- Test pagination with varying dataset sizes.
- Test filtering options.

### **Title: Search Catalog**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog data by NSN or common name so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to search the catalog data by NSN or common name. The search results should be displayed in the same tabular format with pagination and sorting options.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog data page  
WHEN I enter a search term in the search bar and press "Enter"  
THEN I should see the filtered results displayed in the table  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The search should be case-insensitive.
- Results should update dynamically as the user types.
- Pagination and sorting should be maintained for search results.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Modify API to support search query parameters.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement search functionality in the CatalogTable component.
- Ensure UI updates dynamically based on user input.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Backend: Update API to handle search queries.
- Frontend: Implement search bar in the CatalogTable component.
- Frontend: Ensure dynamic updating of results.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with valid and invalid terms.
- Test case insensitivity.
- Test pagination and sorting with search results.

### **Title: Edit Catalog Data**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit product details directly in the table so that I can update the catalog efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit product details directly within the table. Changes should be saved to the database upon confirmation.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing the catalog data  
WHEN I click on a product detail cell and make changes  
THEN I should be able to save the changes, updating the database  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users should be able to edit all editable fields.
- Changes must be saved to the database upon confirmation.
- Feedback should be provided on successful or failed updates.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoints for updating product details in the database.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement inline editing functionality in the CatalogTable component.
- Provide UI feedback for save operations.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Backend: Create/update API for editing product details.
- Frontend: Implement inline editing in CatalogTable.
- Frontend: Implement confirmation and feedback mechanisms.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality for all fields.
- Test database updates after editing.
- Test UI feedback for successful/failed operations.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**###

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the current catalog data as a CSV file so that I can share or back up the data.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to download the current catalog data as a CSV file. The download should include all data currently displayed in the table.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing the catalog data  
WHEN I click the "Download CSV" button  
THEN the system should provide a CSV file containing the current catalog data  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The CSV file should contain all displayed data columns.
- The download should reflect any current filters or sorting.
- File should be named with a timestamp for uniqueness.
