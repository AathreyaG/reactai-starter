### **Title: Upload CSV File**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to upload a CSV file so that I can populate the catalog database efficiently.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to upload a CSV file containing catalog data. The backend should validate, parse, and store this data in PostgreSQL. The UI should provide real-time feedback during upload and notify users upon completion.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the file upload page

WHEN I select a valid CSV file and click "Upload"

THEN the system should process the file, validate its format, and store the data in the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support CSV file uploads up to 100MB.
- If the file is invalid, an error message must be displayed.
- Upon successful upload, data should be inserted into PostgreSQL.
- The system must provide progress feedback while uploading.
- Logs must be stored in AWS CloudWatch for debugging.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an API endpoint in Node.js (Express) to accept CSV files.
- Implement file validation & parsing logic.
- Store processed data in PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM).
- Handle large file processing asynchronously (use AWS Lambda for scalability).

Frontend Implications:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file uploader UI using React.
- Show progress bar & success/failure messages.
- Implement client-side file validation (CSV format, size check).

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the file upload component.
- Frontend: Implement progress bar & error handling.
- Backend: Create Express API to handle file uploads.
- Backend: Implement file parsing logic.
- Backend: Store data in PostgreSQL.
- Backend: Log upload status to AWS CloudWatch.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test successful file upload (valid CSV).
- Test invalid file formats (TXT, JSON).
- Test upload with a corrupt CSV file.
- Test large file handling (100MB limit).
- Test backend database storage & query performance.
- Perform security tests (malicious file uploads, SQL injection protection).

### **Title: Search Catalog**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to search the catalog so that I can quickly find specific products.

Functional Description:

The search functionality allows users to query the catalog database for specific products using various filters such as NSN, rep_office, or common_name.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I enter search criteria and submit

THEN the system should return a list of products matching the criteria

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system must support searching by NSN, rep_office, common_name, and other fields.
- Results should be returned within 2 seconds for typical queries.
- If no products match, a "No results found" message should be displayed.
- Pagination must be supported for large result sets.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create a search API endpoint in Node.js.
- Implement query logic with Sequelize to filter results from PostgreSQL.

Frontend Implications:

- Add a search bar component to the catalog management page.
- Display search results dynamically with pagination controls.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the search bar component.
- Frontend: Implement dynamic result display and pagination.
- Backend: Create search API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement filtering logic in Sequelize.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test search functionality with various criteria.
- Test response time for typical queries.
- Test pagination for large result sets.
- Test edge cases with no matching products.

### **Title: Edit Catalog Entry**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to edit catalog entries so that I can update product details as needed.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to edit details of catalog entries directly from the UI, with changes being updated in the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am viewing a catalog entry

WHEN I click "Edit" and modify the entry details

THEN the system should save the changes to the database

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users must be able to edit fields such as NSN, common_name, and Description.
- Changes should be saved persistently to PostgreSQL.
- An error message should be displayed if saving fails.

Story Points: 3 (Simple complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create API endpoints for updating catalog entries.
- Implement validation logic to ensure data integrity.

Frontend Implications:

- Implement an edit form for catalog entries.
- Provide feedback on successful or failed updates.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the edit form component.
- Frontend: Implement feedback mechanisms for save operations.
- Backend: Create update API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement validation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test editing functionality for different fields.
- Test database update operations.
- Test error handling for failed updates.
- Test data validation logic.

### **Title: Download Catalog as CSV**

User Role: As a Catalog Manager, I want to download the catalog as a CSV file so that I can share it or use it offline.

Functional Description:

The system should allow users to export the entire catalog or a subset of it as a CSV file, generated dynamically from the database.

**GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Scenario**:

GIVEN I am on the catalog management page

WHEN I click "Download CSV"

THEN the system should generate and download a CSV file of the catalog

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The download feature must support exporting up to the entire catalog of 2.5 million items.
- The CSV file must include all relevant fields such as NSN, common_name, and Description.
- The download should initiate within 5 seconds.

Story Points: 5 (Moderate complexity)

**Impact Analysis**:

Backend Implications:

- Create an export API endpoint to generate CSV files.
- Implement logic to handle large data exports efficiently.

Frontend Implications:

- Add a "Download CSV" button to the UI.
- Handle user interactions for initiating downloads.

**Development Subtasks**:

- Frontend: Build the download button component.
- Frontend: Implement user interaction logic.
- Backend: Create export API endpoint.
- Backend: Implement efficient CSV generation logic.

**Testing Subtasks**:

- Test CSV download for full and partial catalog.
- Test file format and data integrity.
- Test performance for large data exports.
- Test edge cases with no data to export.
